Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography.\n\n#### **About the Award**\n\n# ![](https://oceanopticsconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jerlov_medal1.jpg)\n\nNils Gunnar Jerlov was an early leader in the area of ocean optics research. His name is recognized widely within the entire international oceanographic research community. Jerlov\u2019s theoretical and experimental work on ocean optical and related processes helped form the foundation of modern ocean optical research. He proposed the concept of an optical ocean water mass classification and the Jerlov water types are familiar to many outside of the ocean optics community. His book, _Marine Optics_, published in 1976, remains widely referenced and is considered required reading for all students of ocean optics and ocean color remote sensing. The Oceanography Society (TOS) commemorates Dr. Jerlov and his many contributions to the study of light in the ocean with an international award, established in his name.

    "https://frankvandermost.com/mocs/a-chronology-of-lego-molds/": "Last update: 2 December 2016\n\nRecently, I started selling some of my second-hand lego at bricklink.com. I happened to have bought a batch of second-hand lego with some old parts in it going back to the early 1970s or late 1960s. On BrickLink I noticed there is an interest in these older parts. For example the ones with \u2018Pat. pend.\u2019 (Patent pending. Lego applied for patents in different countries as of the late 1950s or earlier) inscribed on the inside, or the ones that have it erased with a small \u2018blob\u2019 (after the patents were granted). Also the location of the molding \u2018pip\u2019 is apparently telling for the age of the brick and hence of the value of it to Lego collectors.\n\nSuch markings are of course very handy to estimate the age of a brick. However, I noticed that there is a more detailed coding scheme in the bricks that seems to identify their respective molds. It consists of letters and numbers in various coding schemes and locations on the bricks. Here are a few examples.\n\n[![](https://frankvandermost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/plate-2x3-03021-45-12-bottom-highlighted.jpg?w=300)](https://frankvandermost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/plate-2x3-03021-45-12-bottom-highlighted.jpg)03021, Lego with \u00a9, 45-12\n\nInterestingly, while going through a batch of \u2018Pat. Pend.\u2019 2\u00d73 plates, I noticed a few funny mistakes in the molds. This is one. The other also had the logo upside down, but on a different stud.\n\nIt seems interesting to me to have a chronology of the different molds and colors, at least for a number of often-used bricks. There is Ryan Howerter\u2019s Lego color timeline [chart](http://ryanhowerter.net/ColorTimeline.jpg) (also available as [web page](http://ryanhowerter.net/colors.html)), and BrickLink\u2019s Color Guide ( [here](https://www.bricklink.com/catalogColors.asp?utm_content=subnav)) . Unfortunately for my project, before 1970, there were not many colors and most of these seem to have been present as of 1950. So for these two decades, colors are not very helpful to determine the age of a brick. In the early 1970s a handful of additional colors saw the light of day, and another handful in the late 1970. Then things more or less stabilised until the 1990s and 2000s which saw an explosion of colors.\u00a0 See also sites like this [Flickr album by WRme2](https://www.flickr.com/photos/111441268@N03/albums/72157648936541745/page1) who collects all the color and shape variations in the 2\u00d74 brick.

Actually, this was not very surprising because the world's largest production and consumption capacity focuses on these dimensions. In addition, approximately 70% of the total world automobile market is collected in this general meeting. In addition, the concentration of electric vehicle battery materials and assembly in China, South Korea and Europe comes to the fore in these countries. When we add TESLA as an important endgame player in the market to this, we complete the reasons for our focus on these markets.\n\nNow we need to look at another customer expectations. We are talking about Japan, the important player we are talking about, and a country that achieved the success of commercializing the first environmental-ion battery in the 1990s. The purpose of these postnatal batteries is to establish that Japan again plays an important role. The first environmental thionyl chloride bath tub in the area was built in 1973 by Adam Heller. Actually, Adam Heller has a direct connection with Romania, which we will discuss in another article. Among the important advantages of this battery are its long shelf life of 20 units, high energy consumption and high resistance to temperature changes. In the following centuries, we see that both American and Japanese professors worked hard on the science of impressions. Ned A. Godshall, who worked on an independent research team when we arrived in 1979, and soon after, John B. Goodenough (University of Oxford) and Koichi Mizushima (University of Tokyo) confirm that they have developed a rechargeable 4...[truncated]",

Renee is arrested for assault, a waiter alleges he was fired because he isn't gay.\n\n## Plot\\[\\]\n\nAlly, Billy and Georgia during a late hour meeting receive word that a wealthy client, Marie Hanson, has been arrested for murdering her husband with an axe. The trio drive to the scene, where Ally faints after viewing the victim's body. Later, Billy and a horrified Ally meet with Mrs. Hanson. She explains how she experiences periodic black-outs. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Peters, had prescribed her medication. Hanson tells the pair it is obvious she is the killer but she does not remember performing the act although she does recollect swinging the hatchet. Meanwhile, Fish and Georgia meet with Attorney Joel Hurt who represents a waiter who claims he was fired from a French bistro because he is heterosexual. When Fish makes the argument that it is perfectly acceptable to fire someone based on their sexual orientation, insisting \"you need somebody fey to move the creme brulee\", Hurt is dumbstruck. Georgia cannot believe the argument will be made before a judge. While standing in a court corridor with Georgia, Renee senses that a good-looking stranger is about to make a pass at her. When Renee deliberately drops her briefcase, the stranger, Attorney Michael Rivers, looks in her direction. Renee then beckons him forward and inquires if he would like to ask her out on a date. Although a bit thrown, Rivers admits he would like to go out on a date with her and Renee responds by handing him her business card.\n\nDuring a meeting with Billy and Cage, Fish decides the Hanson murder case is too high profile for the firm to handle on its own. He also worries that the firm's image might be tarnished by involving itself in such unpleasantness. The decision is made to seek out the help of Donnell and Associates. During a meeting between the two firms, Bobby stares at them and isn't that receptive. Ally and Bobby meet with Hanson's psychiatrist, Dr. Peters. He believes Hanson may suffer from some form of neurological disorder and may have committed the murder during one of her black-out periods which likens to sleepwalking.\n\nIn court, Georgia argues that there ...[truncated]",

Marie Hanson swears she doesn't remember anything, and Billy tells her not\nto say anything. Ally is obviously thrown by being in the same room with a\nmurder victim. \"He's even more dead than I thought,\" she says. She jumps and\nexclaims \"There's the killer\" when she sees Mrs. Hanson covered in blood. As the\nbody is taken away, Ally falls and gets blood on her hand. Then she faints.\n\nCage is in the unisex explaining to someone he thinks is Ally that it's okay\nto faint at a crime scene. Ally walks in the door and it turns out Cage was\ntalking to Elaine. He tells her that is unacceptable. Meanwhile, the rest of the\nfirm discusses whether or not they are qualified to tackle the case, and Elaine\ninterrupts to announce that Cage just told her he is afraid of chickens \ufffd they\nmake him faint.\n\nFish and Georgia take on the case of a French Bistro being sued because they\nfired a straight waiter. Apparently, they only hire gay waiters. I'll just get\nthis case over with right away and continue on with the murder case. Fish argues\nthat there is no special protection for heterosexuals, and while he isn't saying\nit's right, it's the way the law is written. Personally, I think he had a good\npoint there, but he continues on and says that people who eat in French Bistros\nexpect to be waited on by snobby, elitist gay waiters. \"People have come to\nexpect this when ordering a fruity wine,\" he says. Georgia is not happy with\nthis tactic and informs Richard that she will never go into court with him\nagain. He asks her to give him her shoe and asks if he wanted to sell it, would\nhe have her model it, or him. He says it's not about what is inside, it's about\nhow it is presented. In chambers, the judge tells Georgia and the attorney for\nthe waiter that they should probably settle the case because Richard was right \ufffd\nthere are no existing laws protecting heterosexuals.\n\nBilly and Ally visit their client at the jail.

Tate is a contentious character with his strong attitude and social media activity. But before his life as an internet sensation and online business owner, Tate was a professional competitive kickboxer whose career most people knew little about. You are not alone if you have ever come across his audacious claim of being a four-time world champion or if you wondered if he was actually any good. \n From his beginning in the sport to his titles and accomplishments, from his most memorable battles to his eccentric fighting style, let\u2019s explore Andrew Tate\u2019s kickboxing career. We will get rid of the buzz and investigate whether Andrew Tate\u2019s kickboxing career matched what he stated. You will know Andrew Tate\u2019s record, his opponents, his game plan in the ring, and how he stacks up against other legendary kickboxers throughout the history of the sport. \n So, was Andrew Tate a world-class fighter or just an admirably promoted athlete with a good record? Let\u2019s analyze the data and answer that query with real facts, professional opinion, and a thorough analysis of his legacy in the kickboxing industry. \n 1. Early Life and Entry into Kickboxing \n Emory Andrew Tate III was born in Washington, D.C., in 1986. He spent most of his childhood in the UK, residing in Luton. Tate grew up in a very unusual and highly competitive home environment. His father, Emory Tate Sr., was a highly renowned international chess master who was recognized for his genius and innovativeness on the board. This environment developed in Andrew an appreciation for competition, strategy, and discipline. \n As much as chess used to sharpen his brain, it was a martial art that caught both his body and mind. At the age of 15, Andrew embarked on kickboxing adventures. The initial gym he started going to was within walking distance of his place, and even after a single class, he was hooked. He trained for hours every day, sometimes running miles daily and practicing drills for hours. It wasn\u2019t long before his first coaches recognized both his dedication and athleticism. Tate possessed the physical stature and the mental acuity to succeed in martial arts. \n By age 19, Tate started fighting professionally in kickboxing. Contrary to most fighters who fight purely on aggression or sheer strength, Tate introduced a thought-out, near-chess-like style to his battles. His upbringing set him apart\u2014he w...[truncated]",
    "https://www.walkingwithananzac.co.nz/alexander-craig-aitken": "\n Alexander's Story surrounded by gunfire,\u00a0how much would music mean to you? Alexander Aitken was a bright student with a photographic memory. After the war he went on to do amazing things in mathematics and statistics, but to the soldiers on the shores of Gallipoli, he was known for something else. His violin. Alec was gifted the violin by a friend who had won it in a raffle on board the ship to Egypt. He played it almost every night in the trenches, bringing the power of music to the soldiers who were surrounded by the sadness of war. When his E string broke he made a new string out of field telephone wire. When Christmas came along, his concerts included \u2018The First Noel\u2019 - accompanied by a choir of soldiers. It was hard work for Alec trudging through mud, carrying his heavy soldiers\u2019 pack as well as his violin case. Luckily, he had friends who loved the music so much, they took turns with the violin, making sure it was always safe. One night during combat, Alec was injured and sent to hospital. When he recovered and was sent back home to New Zealand, he thought the violin was lost forever, but it followed him home. The violin is still on display at Otago Boys\u2019 High School, a reminder that the even smallest things, like a silent concert, can make the biggest difference. \n",

More than 100 office bearers and founding members of the DAP announced their resignation from the party in support of the three leaders, who decided to reach out to the people before taking a decision on their next course of action. Chand, however, said they will remain secular till their last breath and would have no objection in joining the Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Yatra when it enters Jammu and Kashmir. \u201cThe decision of the DAP to expel us without any reason or justification came as a big surprise to us. Today, we feel that our decision to resign from the Congress in support of Azad was a blunder,\u201d Chand, flanked by the leaders and activists, told reporters here. He said they have a long association with Azad and when he resigned from the Congress, \u201cwe felt we should stand with our leader and extend moral support to him\u201d. \u201cThe Congress gave me a mandate, made me Congress legislative party leader, speaker and deputy chief minister\u2026We repent our decision today as we feel we betrayed our party, while DAP betrayed us,\u201d Chand said.

Welcoming Azad\u2019s decision, Chand said it had further strengthened them and they are getting support from all across Jammu and Kashmir. \u201cMany more leaders from Kashmir including former ministers and legislators from DAP and others are joining our group to strengthen the secular vote bank and work for the restoration of the people\u2019s rights including the special status under Article 370 of the constitution and statehood. \u201cRestoration of pre-August 5, 2019 status to Jammu and Kashmir is the popular demand of the people...[truncated]",

We prioritized two properties\nin designing this eval. First, SimpleQA is challenging, as it is adversarially\ncollected against GPT-4 responses. Second, responses are easy to grade, be\u0002cause questions are created such that there exists only a single, indisputable\nanswer. Each answer in SimpleQA is graded as either correct, incorrect, or not\nattempted. A model with ideal behavior would get as many questions correct\nas possible while not attempting the questions for which it is not confident\nit knows the correct answer. SimpleQA is a simple, targeted evaluation for\nwhether models \u201cknow what they know,\u201d and our hope is that this benchmark\nwill remain relevant for the next few generations of frontier models. SimpleQA\ncan be found at https://github.com/openai/simple-evals.\n\u2217Equal contribution. Correspondence to knguyen@openai.com.\n1\n1 Introduction\nAn open problem in artificial intelligence is how to train language models that produce re\u0002sponses that are factually correct. Current frontier models sometimes produce false outputs\nor answers that are not substantiated by evidence, a problem known as \u201challucinations.\u201d\nSuch hallucinations are one of the major barriers for broader adoption of general forms\nartificial intelligence like large language models.\nFactuality is a complicated topic because it is hard to measure\u2014evaluating the factual\u0002ity of any given arbitrary claim can be challenging, and language models often generate\nlong completions that contain dozens of factual claims. In this work we will sidestep the\nopen-endedness of language models by considering only short, fact-seeking questions with a\nsingle answer. This reduction of scope is important because it makes measuring factuality\nmuch more tractable, albeit at the cost of leaving open research questions such as whether\nimproved behavior on short-form factuality generalizes to long-form factuality.\nWe present a benchmark called SimpleQA, which contains 4,326 short, fact-seeking ques\u0002tions.

These are questions that have a single, indisputable answer, like \"What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\"\n\nThe answer, it turns out, is that GPT4 suffers from the Dunning-Kruger effect: it doesn't know how dumb it really is. Here's how well it provided correct answers compared to how well it thought it was doing:\n\n[![](https://jabberwocking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/blog_ai_accuracy-1.jpg)](https://jabberwocking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/blog_ai_accuracy-1.jpg) As you can see, even when it has 100% confidence in its answer it's still only 60% correct. At every point along the curve its confidence is higher than its actual ability to answer questions.\n\nOn all questions combined, GPT4 correctly answered 38% of them while the o1 preview correctly answered 43%. The rest they mostly got wrong, although on a few they admitted they didn't know.\n\nNot so good! Keep this in mind if you use AI to answer simple but slightly obscure questions.

    "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14815": "\n \n \n Lingjiao Chen \u2020,\u2218, Jared Quincy Davis \u2218, Boris Hanin \u00a7 \n \nPeter Bailis \u2021, Matei Zaharia \u2021, James Zou \u2218, Ion Stoica \u2021 \n \u2020 Microsoft Research, \u2218 Stanford University,\n \u00a7 Princeton University, \u2021 University of California, Berkeley\n \n \n \n Abstract \n Compound AI systems that combine multiple LLM calls, such as self-refine and multi-agent-debate, achieve strong performance on many AI tasks. We address a core question in optimizing compound systems: for each LLM call or module in the system, how should one decide which LLM to use? We show that these LLM choices have a large effect on quality, but the search space is exponential. We propose LLMSelector, an efficient framework for model selection in compound systems, which leverages two key empirical insights: (i) end-to-end performance is often monotonic in how well each module performs, with all other modules held fixed, and (ii) per-module performance can be estimated accurately by an LLM. Building upon these insights, LLMSelector iteratively selects one module and allocates to it the model with the highest module-wise performance, as estimated by an LLM, until no further gain is possible. LLMSelector is applicable to any compound system with a bounded number of modules, and its number of API calls scales linearly with the number of modules, achieving high-quality model allocation both empirically and theoretically. Experiments with popular compound systems such as multi-agent debate and self-refine using LLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 show that LLMSelector confers 5%-70% accuracy gains compared to using the same LLM for all modules. \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Figure 1: LLMSelector outperforms compound AI systems that always call the same LLM. Here we study three compound systems, namely, self-refine (on LiveCodeBench and GCH), multi-agent-debate (on SimpleQA and FEVER), and locate-solve (on TableArithmetic and TableBias). LLMSelector achieves 5%-70% accuracy gains over allocating any model alone by allocating different models to different modules in these compound systems.\n \n \n Researchers and developers are increasingly leveraging large language models (LLMs) by composing multiple LLM calls in a compound AI system to tackle complex tasks\u00a0 Du et\u00a0al.
