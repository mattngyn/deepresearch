Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography.\n\n#### **About the Award**\n\n# ![](https://oceanopticsconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jerlov_medal1.jpg)\n\nNils Gunnar Jerlov was an early leader in the area of ocean optics research. His name is recognized widely within the entire international oceanographic research community. Jerlov\u2019s theoretical and experimental work on ocean optical and related processes helped form the foundation of modern ocean optical research. He proposed the concept of an optical ocean water mass classification and the Jerlov water types are familiar to many outside of the ocean optics community. His book, _Marine Optics_, published in 1976, remains widely referenced and is considered required reading for all students of ocean optics and ocean color remote sensing. The Oceanography Society (TOS) commemorates Dr. Jerlov and his many contributions to the study of light in the ocean with an international award, established in his name.

    "https://frankvandermost.com/mocs/a-chronology-of-lego-molds/": "Last update: 2 December 2016\n\nRecently, I started selling some of my second-hand lego at bricklink.com. I happened to have bought a batch of second-hand lego with some old parts in it going back to the early 1970s or late 1960s. On BrickLink I noticed there is an interest in these older parts. For example the ones with \u2018Pat. pend.\u2019 (Patent pending. Lego applied for patents in different countries as of the late 1950s or earlier) inscribed on the inside, or the ones that have it erased with a small \u2018blob\u2019 (after the patents were granted). Also the location of the molding \u2018pip\u2019 is apparently telling for the age of the brick and hence of the value of it to Lego collectors.\n\nSuch markings are of course very handy to estimate the age of a brick. However, I noticed that there is a more detailed coding scheme in the bricks that seems to identify their respective molds. It consists of letters and numbers in various coding schemes and locations on the bricks. Here are a few examples.\n\n[![](https://frankvandermost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/plate-2x3-03021-45-12-bottom-highlighted.jpg?w=300)](https://frankvandermost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/plate-2x3-03021-45-12-bottom-highlighted.jpg)03021, Lego with \u00a9, 45-12\n\nInterestingly, while going through a batch of \u2018Pat. Pend.\u2019 2\u00d73 plates, I noticed a few funny mistakes in the molds. This is one. The other also had the logo upside down, but on a different stud.\n\nIt seems interesting to me to have a chronology of the different molds and colors, at least for a number of often-used bricks. There is Ryan Howerter\u2019s Lego color timeline [chart](http://ryanhowerter.net/ColorTimeline.jpg) (also available as [web page](http://ryanhowerter.net/colors.html)), and BrickLink\u2019s Color Guide ( [here](https://www.bricklink.com/catalogColors.asp?utm_content=subnav)) . Unfortunately for my project, before 1970, there were not many colors and most of these seem to have been present as of 1950. So for these two decades, colors are not very helpful to determine the age of a brick. In the early 1970s a handful of additional colors saw the light of day, and another handful in the late 1970. Then things more or less stabilised until the 1990s and 2000s which saw an explosion of colors.\u00a0 See also sites like this [Flickr album by WRme2](https://www.flickr.com/photos/111441268@N03/albums/72157648936541745/page1) who collects all the color and shape variations in the 2\u00d74 brick.

Actually, this was not very surprising because the world's largest production and consumption capacity focuses on these dimensions. In addition, approximately 70% of the total world automobile market is collected in this general meeting. In addition, the concentration of electric vehicle battery materials and assembly in China, South Korea and Europe comes to the fore in these countries. When we add TESLA as an important endgame player in the market to this, we complete the reasons for our focus on these markets.\n\nNow we need to look at another customer expectations. We are talking about Japan, the important player we are talking about, and a country that achieved the success of commercializing the first environmental-ion battery in the 1990s. The purpose of these postnatal batteries is to establish that Japan again plays an important role. The first environmental thionyl chloride bath tub in the area was built in 1973 by Adam Heller. Actually, Adam Heller has a direct connection with Romania, which we will discuss in another article. Among the important advantages of this battery are its long shelf life of 20 units, high energy consumption and high resistance to temperature changes. In the following centuries, we see that both American and Japanese professors worked hard on the science of impressions. Ned A.

Renee is arrested for assault, a waiter alleges he was fired because he isn't gay.\n\n## Plot\\[\\]\n\nAlly, Billy and Georgia during a late hour meeting receive word that a wealthy client, Marie Hanson, has been arrested for murdering her husband with an axe. The trio drive to the scene, where Ally faints after viewing the victim's body. Later, Billy and a horrified Ally meet with Mrs. Hanson. She explains how she experiences periodic black-outs. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Peters, had prescribed her medication. Hanson tells the pair it is obvious she is the killer but she does not remember performing the act although she does recollect swinging the hatchet. Meanwhile, Fish and Georgia meet with Attorney Joel Hurt who represents a waiter who claims he was fired from a French bistro because he is heterosexual. When Fish makes the argument that it is perfectly acceptable to fire someone based on their sexual orientation, insisting \"you need somebody fey to move the creme brulee\", Hurt is dumbstruck. Georgia cannot believe the argument will be made before a judge. While standing in a court corridor with Georgia, Renee senses that a good-looking stranger is about to make a pass at her. When Renee deliberately drops her briefcase, the stranger, Attorney Michael Rivers, looks in her direction. Renee then beckons him forward and inquires if he would like to ask her out on a date. Although a bit thrown, Rivers admits he would like to go out on a date with her and Renee responds by handing him her business card.\n\nDuring a meeting with Billy and Cage, Fish decides the Hanson murder case is too high profile for the firm to handle on its own. He also worries that the firm's image might be tarnished by involving itself in such unpleasantness. The decision is made to seek out the help of Donnell and Associates. During a meeting between the two firms, Bobby stares at them and isn't that receptive. Ally and Bobby meet with Hanson's psychiatrist, Dr. Peters. He believes Hanson may suffer from some form of neurological disorder and may have committed the murder during one of her black-out periods which likens to sleepwalking.\n\nIn court, Georgia argues that there ...[truncated]",

Marie Hanson swears she doesn't remember anything, and Billy tells her not\nto say anything. Ally is obviously thrown by being in the same room with a\nmurder victim. \"He's even more dead than I thought,\" she says. She jumps and\nexclaims \"There's the killer\" when she sees Mrs. Hanson covered in blood. As the\nbody is taken away, Ally falls and gets blood on her hand. Then she faints.\n\nCage is in the unisex explaining to someone he thinks is Ally that it's okay\nto faint at a crime scene. Ally walks in the door and it turns out Cage was\ntalking to Elaine. He tells her that is unacceptable. Meanwhile, the rest of the\nfirm discusses whether or not they are qualified to tackle the case, and Elaine\ninterrupts to announce that Cage just told her he is afraid of chickens \ufffd they\nmake him faint.\n\nFish and Georgia take on the case of a French Bistro being sued because they\nfired a straight waiter. Apparently, they only hire gay waiters. I'll just get\nthis case over with right away and continue on with the murder case. Fish argues\nthat there is no special protection for heterosexuals, and while he isn't saying\nit's right, it's the way the law is written. Personally, I think he had a good\npoint there, but he continues on and says that people who eat in French Bistros\nexpect to be waited on by snobby, elitist gay waiters. \"People have come to\nexpect this when ordering a fruity wine,\" he says.

Tate is a contentious character with his strong attitude and social media activity. But before his life as an internet sensation and online business owner, Tate was a professional competitive kickboxer whose career most people knew little about. You are not alone if you have ever come across his audacious claim of being a four-time world champion or if you wondered if he was actually any good. \n From his beginning in the sport to his titles and accomplishments, from his most memorable battles to his eccentric fighting style, let\u2019s explore Andrew Tate\u2019s kickboxing career. We will get rid of the buzz and investigate whether Andrew Tate\u2019s kickboxing career matched what he stated. You will know Andrew Tate\u2019s record, his opponents, his game plan in the ring, and how he stacks up against other legendary kickboxers throughout the history of the sport. \n So, was Andrew Tate a world-class fighter or just an admirably promoted athlete with a good record? Let\u2019s analyze the data and answer that query with real facts, professional opinion, and a thorough analysis of his legacy in the kickboxing industry. \n 1. Early Life and Entry into Kickboxing \n Emory Andrew Tate III was born in Washington, D.C., in 1986. He spent most of his childhood in the UK, residing in Luton. Tate grew up in a very unusual and highly competitive home environment. His father, Emory Tate Sr., was a highly renowned international chess master who was recognized for his genius and innovativeness on the board. This environment developed in Andrew an appreciation for competition, strategy, and discipline. \n As much as chess used to sharpen his brain, it was a martial art that caught both his body and mind. At the age of 15, Andrew embarked on kickboxing adventures. The initial gym he started going to was within walking distance of his place, and even after a single class, he was hooked. He trained for hours every day, sometimes running miles daily and practicing drills for hours. It wasn\u2019t long before his first coaches recognized both his dedication and athleticism. Tate possessed the physical stature and the mental acuity to succeed in martial arts. \n By age 19, Tate started fighting professionally in kickboxing. Contrary to most fighters who fight purely on aggression or sheer strength, Tate introduced a thought-out, near-chess-like style to his battles. His upbringing set him apart\u2014he w...[truncated]",

We prioritized two properties\nin designing this eval. First, SimpleQA is challenging, as it is adversarially\ncollected against GPT-4 responses. Second, responses are easy to grade, be\u0002cause questions are created such that there exists only a single, indisputable\nanswer. Each answer in SimpleQA is graded as either correct, incorrect, or not\nattempted. A model with ideal behavior would get as many questions correct\nas possible while not attempting the questions for which it is not confident\nit knows the correct answer. SimpleQA is a simple, targeted evaluation for\nwhether models \u201cknow what they know,\u201d and our hope is that this benchmark\nwill remain relevant for the next few generations of frontier models. SimpleQA\ncan be found at https://github.com/openai/simple-evals.\n\u2217Equal contribution. Correspondence to knguyen@openai.com.\n1\n1 Introduction\nAn open problem in artificial intelligence is how to train language models that produce re\u0002sponses that are factually correct. Current frontier models sometimes produce false outputs\nor answers that are not substantiated by evidence, a problem known as \u201challucinations.\u201d\nSuch hallucinations are one of the major barriers for broader adoption of general forms\nartificial intelligence like large language models.\nFactuality is a complicated topic because it is hard to measure\u2014evaluating the factual\u0002ity of any given arbitrary claim can be challenging, and language models often generate\nlong completions that contain dozens of factual claims. In this work we will sidestep the\nopen-endedness of language models by considering only short, fact-seeking questions with a\nsingle answer. This reduction of scope is important because it makes measuring factuality\nmuch more tractable, albeit at the cost of leaving open research questions such as whether\nimproved behavior on short-form factuality generalizes to long-form factuality.\nWe present a benchmark called SimpleQA, which contains 4,326 short, fact-seeking ques\u0002tions. SimpleQA was designed with a few important properties in mind:\n\u2022 High correctness.

These are questions that have a single, indisputable answer, like \"What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\"\n\nThe answer, it turns out, is that GPT4 suffers from the Dunning-Kruger effect: it doesn't know how dumb it really is. Here's how well it provided correct answers compared to how well it thought it was doing:\n\n[![](https://jabberwocking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/blog_ai_accuracy-1.jpg)](https://jabberwocking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/blog_ai_accuracy-1.jpg) As you can see, even when it has 100% confidence in its answer it's still only 60% correct.

We address a core question in optimizing compound systems: for each LLM call or module in the system, how should one decide which LLM to use? We show that these LLM choices have a large effect on quality, but the search space is exponential. We propose LLMSelector, an efficient framework for model selection in compound systems, which leverages two key empirical insights: (i) end-to-end performance is often monotonic in how well each module performs, with all other modules held fixed, and (ii) per-module performance can be estimated accurately by an LLM. Building upon these insights, LLMSelector iteratively selects one module and allocates to it the model with the highest module-wise performance, as estimated by an LLM, until no further gain is possible. LLMSelector is applicable to any compound system with a bounded number of modules, and its number of API calls scales linearly with the number of modules, achieving high-quality model allocation both empirically and theoretically. Experiments with popular compound systems such as multi-agent debate and self-refine using LLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 show that LLMSelector confers 5%-70% accuracy gains compared to using the same LLM for all modules. \n \n \n \n 1 Introduction \n \n Figure 1: LLMSelector outperforms compound AI systems that always call the same LLM. Here we study three compound systems, namely, self-refine (on LiveCodeBench and GCH), multi-agent-debate (on SimpleQA and FEVER), and locate-solve (on TableArithmetic and TableBias). LLMSelector achieves 5%-70% accuracy gains over allocating any model alone by allocating different models to different modules in these compound systems.\n \n \n Researchers and developers are increasingly leveraging large language models (LLMs) by composing multiple LLM calls in a compound AI system to tackle complex tasks\u00a0 Du et\u00a0al.

They can be dated back to 1754 and were completed at about a year from one another. The painting on show in the Pitti Palace is the last one and shows the entire family, including the youngest, Maximilian, while the first, which is kept in Vienna in Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, shows only eleven children, without Marie Antoinette, who is in the middle painting, which belongs to the collection at Versailles.\n\nThe three canvases are all similar, with the only difference being the growing number of children and the small changes made necessary by a minimum of resemblance required of a portrait that was _first and foremost_ to transmit the impeccable, glossy image of one of Europe\u2019s most important dynasties, responsible its political fates.\u00a0 The arrangement of the two heads of the family, seated on thrones, is identical, as is the central opening, which frames a view from the entrance to Sch\u00f6nbrunn, with two obelisks topped by the imperial eagles, and even the presence of \u201ctwo dogs playing\u201d as listed in the Florentine inventories, a detail that loses all idea of spontaneity, as it is repeated over the years.\n\nThe portrait came to Florence with Peter Leopold, shown standing at the far right, when he came from Vienna as the young successor of his father, Francis Stephen, the first Grand Duke of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, who began their rule over Florence in 1737. Unlike Francis, who with his more prestigious title of Holy Roman Emperor, left the fates of the Grand Duchy to his regents, Peter Leopold of Lorraine ruled until 1790, with commitment and continuity, as well as with an enlightened spirit of reform...[truncated]",

It was completed between 1747 and 1749. It now resides at the Deutsches Historisches Museum.\n\nDuring the period of this portrait it was the height of fashion for the sleeves of a formal gown to be completely covered in pleated or gather laces, as we see here.\n\nThe neckline of her bodice is broad and shallow, nearly reaching the shoulder points and bordered with a broad band of lace. Her blue silk gown is embroidered extensively in the Baroque taste and it is done entirely in silver work. The gown\u2019s skirt appears to be cut in the round, rather than having a visible under skirt.\n\nOver her right shoulder, and massed behind her is a huge swath of cloth of silver that looks to be lined in light colored tan silk velvet. Is it a court train? Is it just an unsubtle nod to staggering wealth? Both are possible.\n\nAlso slamming the point home are the royal implements on the table to her right. There is a scepter and not one but four different crowns. The multiple ...[truncated]",

    "https://www.crayola.com/faqs/what-were-the-original-eight-(8)-colors-in-the-1903-box-of-crayola-crayons-faq": "\n \n \n \n Back to FAQs \n \n \n \n \n Recognizing a need in schools for safe and affordable wax crayons, Binney &amp; Smith created the first box of eight Crayola Crayons in 1903. Sold for a nickel, this box included red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, brown, and black. The Crayola name was coined by Alice Binney, wife of company founder Edwin Binney and a former schoolteacher. It combines the French word for \"chalk\" (\"craie\") with \"ola,\" meaning \"oily.\" Want to know more about our colorful history? Check out the details on Crayola's history page. \n \n If you have additional questions, we would love to hear from you! Feel free to call or text us at 1-800-CRAYOLA \n weekdays between 9 AM and 4 PM Eastern Time. If you would prefer to send us an email, visit our contact us page.\n \n \n Related Questions \n \n Explore answers to common questions, helpful stain removal tips, and creative ideas for making the most of our art supplies and free resources!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Throughout Crayola's history, several crayon colors have been retired, marking significant moments in the evolution of our vibrant palette. 1990 For the first time in Crayola history, eight colors were retired and placed in the Crayola Hall of Fame: blue gray, green blue, lemon yellow, maize, orange red, orange yellow, raw umber, and violet blue. Eight new colors were added: cerulean, dandelion, fuchsia, jungle green, royal purple, teal blue, vivid tangerine, and wild strawberry. 2003 Celebrating a century of bringing color to the world, Crayola introduced four new colors named by Crayola fans! To make room for the new hues, we bid farewell to blizzard blue, magic mint, mulberry, and teal blue. The four new colors that were introduced are: inchworm, jazzberry jam, mango tango, and wild blue yonder. Kudos to our hue heroes - the consumers who voted in the \"Save the Shade\" campaign, ensuring burnt sienna stayed in the pack. 2017 To mark National Crayon Day on March 31st, we announced Dandelion was leaving the pack. To honor this iconic color, we sent Dandelion on a retirement tour to his favorite places. His replacement, Bluetiful, was announced on May 5, 2017. Looking for more historical facts about our colorful company? We've got them on the Crayola History page! \n \n \n \n \n \n Before Crayola\u00ae Crayons were introduced, we produced black marking crayons in 1900. These early crayons, made with dry carbon black and various waxes, are now known as Staonal\u00ae Marking Crayons, widely used in industrial settings. Reco...[truncated]",

Vinayak Ramdasi, the school\u2019s science educator has been nurturing the planetarium\u2019s revival since 2012. (HT) This isn\u2019t a modern digital marvel, but one of India\u2019s oldest operational planetariums \u2014 the Kusumbai Motichand Planetarium \u2014 still running shows on its original Spitz A1 projector, a rare and elegant relic of 1950s space education. Established in 1880 by the Deccan Education Society, New English School has long been associated with pioneering education. But in 1954, it added something rare to its academic arsenal: Asia\u2019s first projection planetarium. Housed within the school\u2019s Y-shaped building, the dome \u2014 just 9 metres across \u2014 may seem modest by modern standards. But what it offers is anything but ordinary. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a science tool. It\u2019s a bridge between heritage and hands-on learning,\u201d said Vinayak Ramdasi, the school\u2019s science educator who has been nurturing the planetarium\u2019s revival since 2012. \u201cEvery session here sparks something new \u2014 questions, wonder, and curiosity.\u201d The Spitz A1 projector, designed by American engineer Armand Spitz with advice from Albert Einstein, was built for affordability and educational access. The version at New English School is possibly the only one in the world still being used for regular shows. Repaired and upgraded over the years \u2014 with new motors, bulbs, and mechanisms to include zodiac constellations \u2014 the projector continues to charm students with the sky as it looked, and will look, across space and time. A unique feature of the planetarium is its ability to recreate the night sky from any time and location. When astronaut Rakesh Sharma visited the school in 2017, Ramdasi recreated the sky above Russia at the exact moment of his historic launch. \u201cIt brought a big smile to his face. That\u2019s what this place does \u2014 it connects personal moments with the cosmos,\u201d he said. The school\u2019s astronomy programme goes far beyond the dome. Through regular night sky observation camps, hands-on research, and a unique daily series \u2014 Roj Ek Prashna Khagolshastracha (A question on astronomy every day) \u2014 students from Class 7 to Class 9 immerse themselves in astronomy like few others in India.

The 24-year-old production coordinator at McKinney advertising agency in Durham, N.C. has been in an inflatable snow globe much of this week -- it was almost three full days Friday morning, as he appeared on _**The Early Show**_.\n\nIt's all being **shown live, 24/7, via Web cam at http://snowglobeboy.mckinney.com** \\-\\- so anyone can take a look.\n\nThe site says he's seeking a world record for time spent in such a spot -- and he wants to spread holiday cheer.\n\nEckerson has been spending 51 minutes a day outside the globe to tend to personal needs.\n\nHe told **co-anchor Harry Smith** his agency wanted to send a \"green\" holiday card this year, and came up with the snow globe idea -- sending out digital cards via the Web site.\n\nEckerson say he loves Christmas, so he was a perfect choice for the project.\n\nHe says he told his bosses, \"I'm totally game\" to be the snow globe boy.\n\nHe plans to leave the globe later Friday to attend his company holiday party. After all, he says, he RSVPed!\n\nEckerson says he's gotten so many e-mails since entering the globe, he can't even respond. \"It's bananas,\" he said. \"It really is!\"\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nView CBS News In\n\nCBS News App[Open](https://www.cbsnews.com/app/?ftag=CNM-16-10abd6g&url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/snow-globe-boy-seeks-record/)\n\nChromeSafari[Continue](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/snow-globe-boy-seeks-record/#app)\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet browser notifications for breaking news, live events, and exclusive reporting.\n\nNot NowTurn On",
    "https://www.ibtimes.com/snowglobe-boy-web-sensation-creates-world-record-205345": "An idea to put a young ad agency worker in a Snow Globe and film it live as an eco-friendly digital holiday card has quickly turned into an Internet phenomenon and created a world record.\n\nEager to show off their creativity, officials from the McKinney advertising agency based in Durham N.C. proposed putting someone in a globe for days on end with brief breaks, then alerted clients about the project through e-mail.\n\nIn the process, which ended Friday, Ben Eckerson, a 24-year-old broadcast producer at the agency, created and set a new world record for spending the longest time inside a giant inflatable snow globe, McKinney said.\n\nHis total time in a 12-foot diameter globe at the agency's office was 78 hours and 30 minutes with only a 51 minutes allowed outside the SnowGlobe per day. Eckerson, now known as Snowglobe Boy said he had hoped for a world record, and also to spread some holiday cheer.\n\nSnowglobe Boy captured the hearts and imaginations of our agency's clients, our friends and holiday lovers from all over the world, said Brad Brinegar, McKinney Chairman and CEO. We're excited to have created a holiday card that served its 'green friendly' purpose and created a completely unique conversation between the agency and people everywhere.\n\nThe event was streamed live at http://snowglobeboy.mckinney.com where viewers could go to chat with him an read his blogs. By the time he ended on Friday, tens of thousands of visitors had visited the site from over 19 countries.\n\nHe came out just in time for the company's Christmas staff party.\n\nThank you to everyone for making this world record happen, said a tired yet jubilant Eckerson. It was so much fun spreading holiday cheer to everyone around the world.\n\nWhile inside the snow globe, Eckerson was entertained with a Playstation, games, and some small exercise equipment. Food was delivered to him daily.\n\n[Winter](https://www.ibtimes.com/tags/winter) [YouTube](https://www.ibtimes.com/tags/youtube)\n\n\u00a9 Copyright IBTimes 2025.

    "https://www.academia.edu/23469774/Regional_brain_wave_activity_changes_associated_with_fatigue": "Assessing brain wave activity is a viable strategy for monitoring fatigue when performing tasks such as driving, and numerous studies have been conducted in this area. However, results of a systematic review on changes in brain wave activity associated with fatigue have revealed equivocal findings. This study investigated brain wave activity associated with fatigue in 48 nonprofessional healthy drivers as they participated in a simulated driving task until they fatigued. The results showed that as a person fatigues, slow wave activity increased over the entire cortex, in theta and in alpha 1 and 2 bands, while no significant changes were found in delta wave activity. Substantial increases also occurred in fast wave activity, though mostly in frontal sites. The results suggest that as a person fatigues, the brain loses capacity and slows its activity, and that attempts to maintain vigilance levels lead to increased beta activity.",

Prefrontal areas may be responsible for inhibitory top-down control processes and alpha synchronization seems to reflect this modulation. The objective of this study was to measure frontal absolutealpha-power with qEEG in 24 subjects with panic disorder and agoraphobia (PDA) compared to 21 healthy controls. qEEG data were acquired while participants watched a computer simulation, consisting of moments classified as \"high anxiety\"(HAM) and \"low anxiety\" (LAM). qEEG data were also acquired during two rest conditions, before and after the computer simulation display. We observed a higher absolutealpha-power in controls when compared to the PDA patients while watching the computer simulation. The main finding was an interaction between the moment and group factors on frontal cortex. Our findings suggest that the decreased alpha-power in the frontal cortex for the PDA group may reflect a state of high excitability. Our results suggest a possible deficiency in top-down control processes of anxiety reflected by a low absolutealpha-power in the PDA group while watching the computer simulation and they highlight that prefrontal regions and frontal region nearby the temporal area are recruited during the exposure to anxiogenic stimuli. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier ...[truncated]",

This is not\u00a0that.\u201d1\u00a0His works from the mid to late 1960s were intended to express the actions of \u201cprocess.\u201d In so doing, they demonstrate the deployment of basic procedures that activate the primary qualities of media derived from construction and industrial fabrication, such as fiberglass and vulcanized rubber. Produced from molten lead, the works known as \u201csplashings\u201d or \u201ccastings\u201d (or sometimes both) are chief examples of this category of work. Indeed, in their case, the role of process is deepened by the passage of the lead medium\u2014during the on-site production of a given work\u2014from liquid to solid, a material transformation. A splash/cast piece is self-evident, an exposed manifestation of matter plus process\u2014Serra\u2019s nonsymbolic\u00a0this. Process, in turn, implicates change, a temporal register. Given these conditions of medium and change, can we further say that a work\u2019s material and conceptual terms bear meaningful relevance to its eventual fate? One fact is salient, if generally ignored: Serra\u2019s early works from molten lead no longer exist.\n\nTo address the splash/cast pieces as a discrete group is to engage the specificity of their circumstances and means. Serra produced the first six such works in fairly rapid succession in 1968 and 1969. Four were made for group shows in which he was invited to participate. (The molten-lead splashes were one of several types of work he ultimately exhibited.) The initial one was made in 1968 for \u201c9 at Leo Castelli,\u201d organized by\u00a0Robert Morris\u00a0at Castelli Warehouse in New York. The others were produced in 1969: for the exhibition \u201cOp Losse Schroeven\u201d at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (using an exterior wall of the museum); for \u201cWhen Attitudes Become Form\u2014Works, Concepts, Processes, Situations, Information\u201d at the Kunsthalle Bern in Switzerland; and for \u201cAnti-Illusion: Procedures/Materials\u201d at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Each of these shows was devoted to the state of contemporary post-Minimal and Conceptual art practices. A fifth work was made for Serra\u2019s solo exhibition at Castelli Warehouse in 1969. Later that year, the artist executed his final early work from molten lead\u2014in Jasper Johns\u2019s studio, a former bank building...[truncated]",

But for Serra, the particularities of each site really foreground the way in which you, the viewer, are supposed to encounter the work of art.\n\nThe other thing that Serra was very much concerned with is the notion or the idea of process in his works of art. He wants to show the view how the work of art was made. And I think we can see how much this is true in a piece like this splashing or casting piece. Some people might initially look at this work and think: Why, this is quite sloppy; the artist has done nothing to clean up the space in which he was working. But by having the flings, um, having the splashes of lead, and the various drips and drops of lead remain in the site, I think the viewer gets a very real sense of the way in which the artist is flinging, very physically, very gesturally, these materials into all areas of the room.\n\nRead MoreCollapse\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\n[https://sfmoma-media-dev.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www-media/2023/03/02101505/47748\\_sp\\_514a\\_Serra\\_Splash.mp3](https://sfmoma-media-dev.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www...[truncated]",

His father was a Spanish immigrant who worked as a pipefitter on the docks. They watched a steel tanker launch. The size of the hull, the curves of its steel, and the massiveness of its surroundings will find their way into the monumental yet intimate sculptures Serra later created. \n Serra, The Matter of Time (2005) \n \u201cAll the raw material that I needed is contained in the reserve of this memory, which has become a recurring dream.\u201d \n Literature and Muralism \n First, he drew them \u2013 sketches that impressed his parents and his teachers. But at U.C. Santa Barbara, he took up literature instead. He studied alongside Aldous Huxley and Margaret Mead. He read the poetry of Walt Whitman. Emerson became his Bible. Thoreau taught him the virtues of self-reliance. He wrote his thesis on Camus and existential philosophy. \n Serra, Verb List (1967) This list was instrumental for Serra's Process Art, which involves a particular physical action when creating art and sculpture. \n In the summers, he worked at steel factories and watched the building of modern architecture in Downtown San Francisco. Once, he hitchhiked to Mexico to see the works of the Muralists. He was deeply moved by Orozco\u2019s murals at Hospicio Caba\u00f1as. \n \u201cThe sheer strength of the work, the way it wrapped around the interior, the power of his murals completely reconfigured the space. The walls are almost demolished, crumbling under the weight of death and destruction.\u201d \n It was the first time he saw how art can affect architecture, how it can change the sense of space and give it meaning. \n Yale and the Bauhaus \n He came to Yale to study painting and art history. In the company of the likes of Chuck Close, Robert Mangold and Nancy Graves, his self-confidence in painting wavered. The competition among students was fierce, but art was evolving. While Abstract Expressionism still dominated, assemblage and pop art were exploring new mediums. Yale\u2019s curriculum was augmented by visiting artists. Frank Stella, Rauschenberg and Philip Gaston came to give lectures. \n At that time, the art department was greatly influenced by the Bauhaus. The classes explored non-traditional methods and stressed the use of non-art materials. There was a course on Josef Albers\u2019 color t...[truncated]",

    "https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/undercover": "Coverage Collection What\u2019s your idea of a perfect day? Setting his Undercover show to the famous Lou Reed tune and printing perfect day across the hem of a coat or two, Jun Takahashi made us contemplate the question. His agenda for Fall, he said backstage, was \u201cmaking relaxwear for all ages.\u201d There were pajamas, sweats, cozy, cocooning knits, and terrific hybridized outerwear the multigenerational appeal of which he proved by presenting it on a range of women, from young models to the likes of Christina Kruse and Hannelore Knuts to the lined-of-face and silver-haired. It was an inspired casting, and Takahashi received enthusiastic, extended applause. We saw a lesson in it: Shows starring look-alike 17-year-olds are becoming pass\u00e9. Takahashi is a rare original who follows his own path\u2014perhaps working far away in Japan helps him on that score. But he did tap into the season\u2019s surreal undercurrent with renderings of the work of Matthieu Bourel. The German collage artist\u2019s images of women\u2019s faces transformed into masks and puzzle pieces appeared on a sweatshirt, a twinset, and full pants. The effect was eerie, but not sinister. Takahashi doubled down on the surreal with boombox and violin and sand castle\u2013shaped bags; on their heads the models wore dried hydrangeas, branches, and crowns of thorns. The show finished with a trio of barefoot priestesses, their fancy bustier ballgowns affixed to simpler long-sleeved dresses underneath them. We could try parsing Takahashi\u2019s intentions, but it\u2019s the clothes, not the runway dramatics, that will live on. The outerwear in particular was interesting. Like his fellow Japanese designers ( Sacai \u2019s Chitose Abe comes to mind), Takahashi has a thing for hybridizing. He did a shaker-stitch cardigan coat with leather-patch pockets and mismatched sleeves. The silver-haired model\u2019s coat combined double-face cashmere with cotton chino lining and a puffer-jacket back. Both of them were strange and wonderful, and, yep, just about perfect.

Since 2007, Lang has worked with found objects and readily available materials to create a dense, raw, and enigmatic body of work. Lang\u2019s work is process-oriented, and the residue of his experimentation is left visible in the final product. The objects he creates have an intense physicality that evokes the human body and human condition while remaining essentially abstract.\n\nThis exhibition showcases three new bodies of work created between 2015 and 2017. A series of floor sculptures and wall reliefs utilizing memory foam is displayed on the main ground-floor. These eccentric forms hover between abstraction and figuration, physical presence and absence, amputated or erased memories, as the materials he employs also often retain the impression of the human body. Knotted around themselves, the floor sculptures hint at sensations of personal vulnerability. With their soft and sometimes glutinous surfaces and golden-brown colour, they mark a clear break with the multi-coloured vertical monoliths of Lang\u2019s previous exhibition. In his wall reliefs, the foam has been distressed to create imprints on the cusp of attraction and the reality of malfunction. The tactile dimension of both series is especially pronounced, inducing an awareness of different tissues and textures of the body.\n\nThe east gallery on the ground floor features several hanging sculptures made with shellacked paper. Like the memory-foam sculptures, these layered forms possess a strong anthropomorphic presence and an unmistakable erotic charge. There is a suggestion of cruelty in the way that some are suspended at the middle from industrial hooks. Like twisted husks or shed skins, they appear to bear witness to some obscure process of metamorphosis.\n\nThe third body of new work consists of a series of surrogate skin-like wall reliefs in silk, oil, and shellac. This exhibition demonstrates Lang\u2019s ongoing development of a singular and provocative visual language.\n\nHelmut Lang lives and works in New York. He has exhibited since 1996 in Europe and the United States, among others, at the Florence Biennale, Florence (1996); Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna (1998); The Journal Gallery, New York (2007); kestnergesellschaft, Hanover (2008); The Fireplace Project, Long Island (20...[truncated]",

The historic house designed by fellow Austrian Rudolph Schindler provides the spare, proto-minimalist frame for a series of freestanding sculptures. As with all of Lang\u2019s work, the visible and the invisible are put in direct play. Stating his preference for materials \u201cwith a past, elements with irreplaceable presence and with scars and memories of a former purpose,\u201d Lang impregnates the architecturally hallowed space with the powerful but ghostly presences of collective pasts and unknown futures.\n\nEvery house tells a story. Some tell many. The famed Schindler House tells more than most. The architectural story of the first slab-cast modernist house, the progenitor of a mid-century experiment that situated Los Angeles on the intellectual and ideological coastlines of the great European and American traditions is well known. Less well known are the lifestyle experiments, contentions, dreams, allegiances and defections born within. This, the psychic architecture of the storied house, exists in the conversations around light, space, sex, the boundaries between inside and outside, between people seeking new means of manifestation that still cling to t...[truncated]",

His\nsculptures and objects move between figuration and abstraction,\nborrowing from classicism, as well as from modernity.

That he\u2019s always working through his past, rummaging around in the idea of it, transforming it, and also hoping, perhaps, in that way, to leave it behind. And he\u2019s left a lot behind \u2014 insofar as that\u2019s possible, as there aren\u2019t many artists who share their name with an iconic [fashion brand](http://www.helmutlang.com/mens-new/mens-new,default,sc.html) (with a shop in the Meatpacking District) they haven\u2019t owned, or been involved with, in over a decade.

Even after living for 20 years in New York, he seems to worry that he can\u2019t quite express himself exactly as he wants in English, and, he admits, he would have preferred to do an interview over email. (\u201cI\u2019m very bad at making statements.\u201d) That way he could go over it, rethink what he has to say, make sure it is precisely as he\u2019d like it to be. He is, it seems, an iterative, intuitive, just-so person, a reworker and refiner, which, if you think about the insightful [rigor](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/helmut-lang-the-original-urban-outfitter-1960707.html) of his clothing, makes sense, but, as he explains it to me, is also how he works as an artist, starting with a material and an idea of what he might do with it, to transform it, or draw out some hidden quality in it, something haunting...[truncated]",

They aspired to build a university center that could harness the power of empirical research about women in order to promote gender equality. That day, students Beth Garfield, Susan Heck, and Cynthia Russell met at the office of Stanford Business School Professor Myra Strober, and an ambitious and far-reaching plan was hatched.\n\n![Cynthia Russell, Beth Garfield, Myra Strober, Susan Heck, Jing Lyman](https://gender.stanford.edu/sites/gender/files/styles/hs_large_scaled_480px/public/media/image/founders_and_jing_640x425_2_0.jpg?itok=X0TkGS83)\n\nCynthia Russell, Beth Garfield, Myra Strober, Susan Heck, and Jing Lyman\n\nThis fearless foursome worked over the next several months to turn their dream into reality. They managed to win support from faculty and staff, as well as the backing of the woman who would become the Institute\u2019s de facto \u201cguardian angel,\u201d Jing Lyman, the wife of then Stanford President Richard Lyman. In 1974, the Stanford Center for Research on Women\u2014CROW\u2014opened its doors, with Strober as its first director.\n\nCROW, now the Michelle R. Clayman Institute for Gender Research, quickly became a national hub for both cutting-edge research and interdisciplinary dialogue on women\u2019s issues and established Stanford as a leading pioneer in gender scholarship. At a time when the number of college courses relating to women could barely fill a single page of a course guide, the Institute launched the Task Force on the Study of Women. Its work eventually led to the creation of the Feminist Studies Program at Stanford in 1981.\n\nDuring its second decade, the Institute initiated its ongoing trend of focusing research and programming efforts around a specific theme chosen by the new incoming director, which enabled it to leverage each new director\u2019s expertise and networks in a given discipline. The Institute launched this initiative by first addressing the issue of health in relation to women and gender; it then moved on to focus on gender and aging.\n\nAs its third decade began, the theme shifted to harnessing the power of sex and gender analyses for discovery and innovation in science and technology.

In 1866, Charles of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen became Prince. Romania sided with Russia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. In 1878, the Treaties of San Stefano and Berlin recognized Romania\u2019s independence from the Ottoman Empire. Prince Charles became King in 1881.\n\nDuring the twentieth century, U.S. relations with Romania have vacillated between warm (Romania fought on the side of the Allies in the Great War), and cold (Romania declared war upon the United States in 1941 and early Cold War era relations were frosty, at best). The nature of U.S.-Romanian relations began to improve during the 1960s when Romania began to distance its foreign policy from that of the Soviet Union, especially after the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. The 1970s were also a period of warming U.S.-Romania relations fostered by greater cultural, scientific, and educational exchanges; however, during the 1980s criticisms of Romania\u2019s human rights record served to once again strain relations.\n\nSince Romania\u2019s December 1989 revolution, which unseated the Communist regime, the United States has enjoyed a strengthened relationship with Romania.\n\n**U.S. Recognition of Romanian Independence, 1881.**\n\nThe United States recognized the Kingdom of Romania on April 7, 1881, when U.S. Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires [Eugene Schuyler](https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/schuyler-eugene) had an audience with King Charles and announced that the United States recognized the new kingdom. On April 3, U.S. Secretary of State [James G.

Early U.S. Consulates in Romania, 1866-1876.**\n\nThe first U.S. Consul was appointed to Romania while it was still an autonomous part of the Ottoman Empire. Louis J. Czapkay, a native of Hungary but a resident of California, was appointed to Bucharest on June 20, 1866. He served from May 1, 1867 to February 1869.\n\nHis successor, Benjamin Franklin Peixotto, was appointed June 29, 1870, as an expression of U.S. concern with the status of Romania\u2019s Jewish community, which was denied citizenship and subject to persecution.

The O'Gnimh were the hereditary Bards to the great O'Neils of Clan Aodha Bhuidhe in Antrim. The name went through many transformations, O'Gnive, O'Gnyw, MacGnive, finally being anglicized to Agnew.

Having scored in the 98 th percentile on a musical aptitude test, he changed his major to music, which had always been one of his loves. He received his B.S. in 1936, and proceeded to get his Master of Arts degree at Teachers College, Columbia University in 1941. \nFrom 1943 to 1947 David Randolph was a Music Specialist (assistant director) for the United States Office of War Information. In 1947 he became the Music Annotator for the Columbia Broadcasting System, writing the broadcast scripts for concerts by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and all other classical music presentations on the network. In 1946, he began a series of weekly broadcasts called \"Music for the Connoisseur,\" later known as \"The David Randolph Concerts,\" on New York City's radio station WNYC. For his fourth broadcast, on July 23, 1946, he surveyed the subject of \"Humor in Music,\" thus \"inventing\" the type of radio broadcast devoted to a single musical subject with commentary. The broadcasts were later heard nationwide on the 72-station network of the National Association of Educational Broadcasters. These broadcasts, which won four Ohio State University Awards as \"The best programs of music and commentary in the nation,\" continued for 33 years and resulted in invitations from 23 publishers to write a book. His book, This Is Music, was described by The New York Times as \"One of the Best of the Year.\" He also edited The David Randolph Madrigal Series. \nIn 1943 David Randolph organised his own five-voiced madrigal group, The Randolph Singers, which he conducted until 1972. They toured, gave concerts in Town Hall, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Carnegie Recital Hall, made many recordings, and was the subject of a full two-hour \"Today\" show on NBC-TV. In 1948, Randolph married the contralto of the group, Mildred Greenberg, who can be seen in the center box at all of his Carnegie Hall concerts. He was the host of the program \"Lincoln Center Spotlight,\" heard weekly on radio station WQXR; host for \"Young Audiences,\" a series of 39 programs on the CBS Television network; and appeared as a guest on the Metropolitan Opera Intermission broadcasts.

B.A., Ph.D. University of California at Berkeley, faculty member at Yale since 1979: You are a computer scientist known for foundational work in computational learning theory and distributed computing.\n\nThrough your research and service, you helped establish the theoretical foundations of Machine Learning. You integrated Learning Theory with Computational Complexity Theory and demonstrated that algorithms can learn even if there are errors in their data. Where previous researchers considered algorithms that learned by passively observing their environment, you established the theory of algorithms that learn by testing hypotheses and asking questions of teachers. In the service of this important field, you founded the annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory, which is now in its thirty-fourth year.\n\nYou have also done foundational work in the theory of distributed computing, which studies how computers can cooperate to solve problems when connected by a network. Early in your career\u2014before such systems became commonplace with the development of the Internet\u2014you asked the fundamental question of how the power of such a system would be affected if these computers all ran the same code and could be distinguished only by their position in the network. Later, you and other researchers at Yale developed the model of population protocols, which went even further by taking away the structure of the network. Your population protocol model has been used to represent computation by systems ranging from swarms of tiny robots to collections of molecules in a test tube. Its impact on distributed computing was recognized by the award to you of the 2020 Dijkstra Prize, one of the highest honors in this field.\n\nUndergraduates have praised you for your teaching, amazed by the patient way you could think your way into their thought processes, waiting until they themselves saw that they were wrong, and then helping them work backwards until they figured the source of their confusion. You were patient and firm, but at the same time you managed to make your students love their ...[truncated]",

D. in Engineering Science (1976) under the direction of Manuel Blum, both from U.C. Berkeley. Her dissertation applied the then-new theory of computational complexity to problems in learning finite automata and regular expressions. During postdocs with Leslie Valiant (Leeds and Edinburgh Universities) and Ronald Book (U.C. Santa Barbara), she developed new techniques for the analysis of randomized algorithms and learning formal languages from positive examples. From 1979 to 2021 she was a member of the Yale Computer Science Department in a number of roles: Gibbs Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor on Term, Research Scientist, Senior Research Scientist, and Professor. At Yale, her main focus was algorithmic approaches to learning, including query models, errors and omissions, robot localization and map learning, learning languages of infinite words, and forays into learning with artificial neural networks. She helped start the influential Computational Learning Theory (COLT) conference. A research side trip with Yale Computer Science colleagues won the 2020 Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing. Her teaching of Yale undergraduates was recognized by the award of the Dylan Hixon \u201988 Prize for Teaching Excellence in the Natural Sciences (2011), the Harwood F. Byrnes/Richard B.

He joined the All India Institute of Medical Sciences as a faculty member in 1980. Soon after joining AIIMS he began to carry out extensive research in the areas of diarrheal diseases and child nutrition with an emphasis on\u00a0public health\u00a0issues. His early research contributions while at AIIMS include but are not limited to demonstrating the safety and efficacy of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months rather than 4 months for the first time in a developing country including in children with low birth weight; describing the critical combination of persistent diarrhea as a cause of childhood mortality, accounting about 40% diarrhea child death; and Co-Developing a low osmolarity oral rehydration solution, adopted as a WHO recommendation. While it is difficult to enumerate each one of these, please refer to Dr. Bhan\u2019s CV for a more comprehensive list of his research contributions that have led to health impact.\n\n\u200b\n\nHis greatest legacy is unquestionably the development of a rotavirus vaccine based on a neonatal strain collaboration with Dr. Roger Glass, CDC, USA and other collaborators.

Based on Cell Reports.\n\nMetformin is the most extensively used oral therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The American Diabetes Association recommends metformin as the first line treatment for T2DM in conjunction with rigorous physical activity and dietary restriction.\n\n[K Sreekumaran Nair, M.D., Ph.D.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/nair-k-sreekumaran-m-d-ph-d/bio-20053822), with Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism & Nutrition at Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester, Minnesota, says: \"With the rapidly expanding prevalence of T2DM, many novel oral therapeutic agents are emerging, but metformin continues to dominate, both as monotherapy as well as in combination with other medications, including insulin. Metformin can also prevent or delay the onset of T2DM in susceptible populations, such as those with prediabetes, fasting hyperglycemia or impaired glucose tolerance, and it is a safe treatment for pregnant women with gestational diabetes.\n\n\"In women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, metformin is effective not only at improving insulin sensitivity, but also in enhancing their potential for fertility. Currently, over 150 million people worldwide are using metformin.\"\n\nMetformin is a highly desirable therapy for T2DM for a number of reasons. Haleigh A. James, M.D., an endocrine trainee in Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism & Nutrition at Mayo Clinic's campus in Minnesota, notes: \"One of its major advantages is that metformin does not cause significant hypoglycemia. Another advantage is that, unlike hypoglycemic agents such as sulfonylureas or insulin, metformin treatment is not associated with weight gain, but may cause modest weight loss.\n\n\"Some reports indicate that metformin is associated with preferential fat loss, and it may impart mild anorexic effects via its hypothalamic actions. Although there are conflicting reports, metformin may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, especially in patients with T2DM who are overweight. This beneficial effect may be in part due to a modest effect of metformin on reducing blood pressure (unrelated to weight loss), improving lipid profiles (especially triglycerides...[truncated]",

In the 1940s, metformin was rediscovered in the search for antimalarial agents and repurposed to treat influenza, before its introduction, in 1957, for the treatment of adult-onset diabetes (Table 1). However, metformin was considered weaker than other glucose-lowering biguanides and received limited use. When the other biguanides (phenformin and buformin) were withdrawn in the late 1970s because of links to lactic acidosis, metformin was spared, but mostly rejected. However, ongoing research and minimal clinical use in the 1980s and early 1990s demonstrated a uniqueness and utility of metformin that fostered its rescue. The introduction of metformin into the USA in 1995 boosted research and clinical use and long-term evidence from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) in 1998 set metformin on course for its current position as the preferred initial agent to manage hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. Now exonerated, metformin is being assessed for further clinical indications. How could such a medicinal servant have received such a tempestuous journey? Table 1 Landmark events in the history of metformin for the management of type 2 diabetes Full size table \n Herbal history The herbal lineage of metformin can be traced from the use of Galega officinalis (a.k.a. goat\u2019s rue, French lilac, Italian fitch, Spanish sainfoin or professor weed; Fig. 1) as a traditional medicine in medieval Europe [ 1]. Also known as Herba rutae caprariae in some herbals, G. officinalis was ascribed benefits against worms, epilepsy (\u2018falling-sickness\u2019), fever and pestilence in Culpeper\u2019s Complete Herbal of 1653, whilst in 1772, John Hill recommended Galega to treat conditions of thirst and frequent urination [ 2, 3, 4]. In Europe, wild G. officinalis was widely recognised as an animal galactagogue from which it gained its name (\u2018 Galega \u2019 being derived from the Greek for \u2018milk stimulant\u2019). The plant was introduced into North America in 1891 and is now classed as a noxious weed in many states of the USA [ 5]. Chemical analyses of G. officinalis dating from the mid-1800s found the plant to be rich in guanidine and related compounds (shown in Fig. 2), especially the immature seed pods [ 6]. In 1918, guanidine was rep...[truncated]",

Noticing the situation becoming more critical, Oestricher decided to take a risky step: taking off anyway in order to avoid an accident. \n With some difficulty, the YF-16 left the runway and in the air the situation stabilized to the point where the aircraft remained in flight for around six minutes until it was able to land safely. \n It was, however, not the only incident with the fighter, which also landed without landing gear on another occasion, fortunately without causing major damage. \n YF-16 and YF-17 prototypes (USAF) \n \n Defeating the YF-17 and becoming an export product On the way to Ukraine \n Defeating the YF-17 and becoming an export product \n Despite the unforeseen circumstances of that Sunday, January 20, 1974, the F-16 proved to be an excellent product and since then, more than 4,600 of these fighters have been produced, most of which continue to fly in various air forces. \n The YF-16 was the winner of the USAF\u2019s Air Combat Fighter competition in 1976, defeating Northrop\u2019s YF-17, which later gave rise to the F/A-18 Hornet in partnership with McDonnell Douglas. \n The F-16, however, was an aircraft with innovations and well-thought-out solutions, starting with the fly-by-wire system, which replaced cables with electrical controls to control the jet. \n Production F-16 Rollout, 1978 (Lockheed Martin) \n Its configuration included an engine with only a ventral air intake and a raised cockpit with a bubble-shaped canopy.

Locke\nLucio Baccaro\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nJune 24, 1994\n1. Introduction\nItalian unions emerged from the Hot Autumn of 19691 as politically powerful and\nstrategically innovative organizations. Union strength and initiative were expressed both at the\nshop floor, where unions regulated production, internal mobility, and dismissals, and at the\nnational level where they succeeded in promoting social reforms and protecting workers' wages\nagainst inflation.\nThis is no longer the case. Following their defeat in several highly visible strikes and\nthe resurgence of partisan divisions among the three confederations, the unions lost considerable\npower and management regained initiative. As individual firms and entire industries\nrestructured, the unions appeared unable to negotiate, let alone protect their membership against,\nthe consequences of the reorganization. With the emergence of hundreds of thousands of\nredundant industrial workers, union membership among this constituency declined, as did their\nbargaining power in the political arena. Faced with declining political and economic power and\ncontinuous infighting, the unions lost both their strategic capacity and their reformist spirit. As\na result, previous allies of the labor movement began to defect and the unions found themselves\nincreasingly isolated. How do we account for this shift in the political-economic fortunes of the\nItalian unions?\n1 The Hot Autumn (\"autunno caldo\") was a period of intense social and labor mobilization\nthat started with the student protest and mass rallies over pension reform in 1968, reached its\npeak in fall 1969, and lasted until the early 1970s. For more on the Hot Autumn, see Pietro\nMerli Brandini, \"Italy: Creating A New Industrial Relations System from The Bottom.\" in\nSolomon Barkin, ed., Worker Militancy and Its Consequences. 1965-75, (New York: Praeger,\n1975); Alessandro Pizzorno, Emilio Reyneri, Marino Regini and Ida Regalia, Lotte operaie e\nsindacato: il ciclo 1968-1972, (Bologna: I1 Mulino, 1978); and Charles Sabel, Work and Politics,\n(New York: Cambridge University Press, 1981).\n2\nIn contrast to alternative explanations which emphasize either the inevitability of union\ndecline as a result of structural shifts in the e...[truncated]",

The British rulers were left with no option but to eventually accept the demand of the Muslims of India. On 3rd June1947, Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India, called the conference of all the leaders of the Sub-continent and communicated to them his Government's Plan for the transfer of power.\u00a0At that time, a notification was issued in the Gazette of India, published on 26th July 1947 in which the first Constituent Assembly of Pakistan was given shape with 69 Members (later on the membership was increased to 79), including one female Member. The State of Pakistan was created under the Independence Act of 1947. The Act made the existing Constituent Assemblies, the dominion legislatures. These Assemblies were allowed to exercise all the powers which were formerly exercised by the Central Legislature, in addition to the powers regarding the framing of a new Constitution, prior to which all territories were to be governed in accordance with the Government of India Act, 1935. The first session of the first Constituent Assembly of Pakistan was held on 10th August 1947 at Sindh Assembly Building Karachi. On 11th August 1947 Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was elected unanimously as the President of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan and the National Flag was formally approved by the Assembly.![](https://na.gov.pk/uploads/images/quaid.jpg)On 12th August 1947, a resolution was approved regarding officially addressing Mr. Muhamm...[truncated]",

He worked for over ten years with Ernest Rutherford in the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1929 and was the first director (1930\u201334) of the Mond Laboratory in Cambridge. In the 1920s he originated techniques for creating ultrastrong magnetic fields by injecting high current for brief periods into specially constructed air-core electromagnets. In 1928 he discovered the linear dependence of resistivity on magnetic field for various metals in very strong magnetic fields. \n In the 1930s he started doing low temperature research, beginning with a critical analysis of the existing methods for obtaining low temperatures. In 1934 he developed new and original apparatus (based on the adiabatic principle) for making significant quantities of liquid helium. \n Kapitsa formed the Institute for Physical Problems, in part using equipment which the Soviet government bought from the Mond Laboratory in Cambridge (with the assistance of Rutherford, once it was clear that Kapitsa would not be permitted to return). \n In Russia, Kapitsa began a series of experiments to study liquid helium, leading to the discovery in 1937 of its superfluidity (not to be confused with superconductivity). He reported the properties of this new state of matter in a series of papers, for which he was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for basic inventions and discoveries in the area of low-temperature physics\". In 1939 he developed a new method for liquefaction of air with a low-pressure cycle using a special high-efficiency expansion turbine. Consequently, during World War II he was assigned to head the Department of Oxygen Industry attached to the USSR Council of Ministers, where he developed his low-pressure expansion techniques for industrial purposes. He invented high power microwave gene...[truncated]",

To the shock of absolutely no one, politicians and public officials fared better than most\u00a0when the zombie outbreak started. We've encountered Deanna Monroe in the main show, Elizabeth Kublek in\u00a0_[Walking Dead: World Beyond](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-walking-dead-world-beyond/)_, and Senator Vasquez in\u00a0_[Fear The Walking Dead](https://screenrant.com/tag/fear-the-walking-dead/)_, but the latest post-apocalyptic politician is by far the most prominent. Currently leading the [Commonwealth, Pamela Milton](https://screenrant.com/walking-dead-lance-hornsby-pamela-milton-commonwealth-explained/) belongs to a world-renowned political dynasty similar to the Kennedy family. Most survivors are already aware of Pamela\u00a0from before\u00a0_The Walking Dead_'s timeline, which certainly speaks to her fame and reputation.\n\nOne\u00a0_The Walking Dead_ character who knows Pamela Milton\u00a0extremely well is Connie. After spending most of season 10 battling Deviants with her brothers and sisters, Connie made a triumphant return in\u00a0_The Walking Dead_ season 11, part 1. Arriving home to find Alexandria looking somewhat worse for wear, Connie is one of many survivors\u00a0who accept Lance Hornsby's offer to join the Commonwealth. Now back in\u00a0a civilized society, Connie resumes her pre-outbreak career of journalism, snooping out the\u00a0Commonwealth's\u00a0hottest stories - fancy dress competition winners, the hottest masquerade ball outfits, over-sized pumpkins, etc. Back in the day, however, Connie's typewriter was knocking out more hard-hitting scoops... and her reporting\u00a0resum\u00e9 includes none other than Pamela Milton herself.\n\nRelated:\u00a0[Walking Dead Just Gave Negan His Comic Ending (Without Carl)](https://screenrant.com/walking-dead-negan-comic-ending-lydia-not-carl/)\n\n[Connie tells Daryl](https://screenrant.com/walking-dead-daryl-love-triangle-leah-connie-choice/)\u00a0about the time she interviewed Pamela Milton\u00a0_before_ the zombie apocalypse.

In recent episodes of the show's final season, Connie has moved into the seemingly idyllic Commonwealth community.\n\nWith her sister Kelly to act as an interpreter, Connie has quickly slipped into her pre-apocalypse profession as an investigative reporter, looking into the activities of Pamela Milton, the rumours of discontent with the Commonwealth's rigid class based social structure, and possibly a rebellion brewing.

They were also the first to travel the length of the Amazon from the source to the sea, mapping the entire river in a boat they build themselves called The Amazon Queen (1969).\n\nTheir adventures are being made into a feature length documentary film.

She lived an astonishing and important life. Helen grew up in California and met her husband Frank Schreider at UCLA, where she was studying art. On their honeymoon, they began traveling and soon after embarked on their first great exploration from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego (1954\u201356) in an amphibious jeep. Helen and Frank Schreider became the first people, along with their German shepherd Dinah, to travel and explore the length of the Americas solely by means of their own vehicle, an amphibious jeep they called Tortuga.\n\nThroughout their treacherous, action-packed adventure, Helen drew and later painted the fascinating people, animals, jungles, and oceans they encountered along the way. Upon completion, Helen and Frank wrote the book _20,000 Miles South,_ illustrated with Helen\u2019s art and their photograph...[truncated]",

The extra detour by land and sea would drain their fuel and water tanks long before they reached Bajdo. With no chance to send for more gasoline to fuel their amphibious Jeep, Helen and Frank studied tide charts and US Navy nautical books, hoping for an obvious solution. But as the sky darkened, heavy waves crashed while the air\u2019s sweet smell predicted rain. Monsoon season was quickly approaching, reminding the Schreiders that half a thousand miles of unpredictable conditions remained, potentially threatening their trans-Indonesian expedition.\n\nIn 1961, American explorers Helen and Frank Schreider, and their trusty German shepherd, Dinah, embarked on a 5,000-mile _National Geographic_ assignment along the Indonesian chain of islands from Sumatra to East Timor. Their vessel, _Tortuga II_ (the Spanish word for \u201cturtle\u201d), was a WWII-surplus-seafaring Jeep modified to travel by road and by water\u2014an intentional choice to traverse an archipelago of over 18,000 islands stretching nearly to the Australian coast and bordered by the Indian and Pacific oceans.\n\n![Schreiders amphibious jeep](https://expeditionportal.com/media/2023/09/23FALL_Historic-Drums-of-Tonkin-1-scaled.jpg)\n\nThe 30-something adventurers met at the University of California in Los Angeles, where Frank studied engineering and Helen majored in fine arts. They tied the knot in 1947 and spent their honeymoon bushwhacking for eight days through 200 miles of Mexican jungle in a different Jeep, unsuccessfully penetrating the roadless track in southern Costa Rica.\n\nFrank served in the US Navy\u2019s submarine service in the Pacific during World War II. According to Helen, he was an enthusiastic reader during childhood, which resulted in a passionate desire for travel. With a shock of thick brown hair, a knack for mechanical problem-solving, and the ability to winch the bulky _Tortuga II_ out of just about any predicament, Frank was also the man behind the typewriter, undertaking much of the writing.\n\n![](https://expeditionportal.com/media/2023/09/23FALL_Histo...[truncated]",

This program was implemented in the former homelands and other so-called black areas. Conversely the concept was implemented against the wishes of people.\n\nIn this intervening time, a vast number of people lost their stock which was their only source of wealth, subsequent to the application of the Stock Limitation Act (1950) introduced by the state under the pretext of land betterment. The Act thus paved the way for the forced removal or slaughter of cattle belonging to African\u00a0people in the reserves. In terms of the Act, the number of livestock was limited and stock owners (individual or families) paid a small grazing fee annually. This consisted of restrictions on ploughing, prohibitions on cutting trees and the culling of cattle.\n\nBetterment type controls were placed over the agricultural land- in an attempt to prevent overgrazing. Betterment type controls refer to the schemes that were used to regulate homelands under the pretext of improving the areas.\n\nDesignated a...[truncated]",

Still only 26 at the time of that second triumph, Szil\u00e1gyi has since set his sights on a third title at Tokyo 2020._\n\n##### Learning from a master\n\nThe winners of 87 Olympic medals since 1896, including 37 golds, Hungary is a traditional superpower of world fencing, especially in the men\u2019s sabre, an event in which its fencers won 11 out of 12 golds between 1908 and 1964. Leading the way was the late, great Alad\u00e1r Gerevich, who won a record 10 individual and team medals \u2013 seven of them gold \u2013 between Los Angeles 1932 and Rome 1960.\n\nDetermined to follow in that fine tradition, Aron Szil\u00e1gyi took up fencing at the age of nine, learning his trade from Gerevich\u2019s son Gyorgi, a top-level coach at the Budapest fencing club Vasas SC. The Gereviches have proved to be a huge source of inspiration for the young Szil\u00e1gyi, firing him on his rise to the very top of international fencing.\n\n##### Teenage dream\n\nA highly accomplished young performer, Szil\u00e1gyi was 17 when he was called up to the Hungary team for the 2007 FIE World Championships in St Petersburg (RUS), where he collected the first gold medal of his career in the team event with Tam\u00e1s Decs, Bal\u00e1zs Lontay and Zsolt Nemcsik. The Hungarian quartet\u2019s 45-43 defeat of defending champions France gave them their first gold in the event since 1998.\n\nSzil\u00e1gyi made his Olympic debut in Beijing the following year, losing 15-10 to the USA\u2019s Keeth Smart in the last 16, while his team went down 45-44 to the Americans in the quarter-finals. The Hungarians partially atoned for that disappointment by winning bronze at the 2009 Worlds in Antalya (TUR), while Szil\u00e1gyi picked up an individual bronze at the European Championships in Sheffield (GBR) two years later.\n\n##### A first taste of Olympic gold\n\nThe Budapest-born right-hander has lived by the motto \u201cYou can\u2019t always win but you must always try\u201d.

These were usually challenge matches between \ntwo fencers each or both of which called themselves world champions. Prior to the establishment of the Federation Internationale d\u2019Escrime \n(FIE) in 1913, however, there was no international body to sanction a real world championship. It was not until after World War I and the 1920 \nOlympic Games, though, that the FIE finally sanctioned a championship. In these early championships, each nation was allowed to enter a \nmaximum of eight fencers.\nFrom 1921 through 1936 (except in the Olympic years of 1924 and 1928) the FIE sanctioned yearly competitions called the \u201cChampionnats \nd'Europe\u201d (\u201cEuropean Championships\u201d). In spite of their name, non-Europeans were allowed to compete in them and so these competitions are \nconsidered to be the first world championships for fencing. It was not until 1937 that the FIE officially changed the name of the competitions \nfrom \u201cChampionnats d'Europe\u201d to \u201cChampionnats du Monde\u201d.\nMen's Epee Individual (1921.VI.10-11) Nations: 8\nThe European Championships were held as one of the events during the Grande Semaine des Armes de Combat which ran from June 5 to 12 and \nincluded the French national fencing championships and other fencing events as well as shooting events. Only one European Championship \nevent was contested: men's epee individual. Fencers from Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, and \nSwitzerland competed. The format of the event was 3 rounds of pools. The first round was three pools with six qualifying from each pool and the \nsecond round was two pools with six qualifying to a final pool of 12. Bouts were for one touch in the first two rounds and for two touches in the \nfinals. Lucien Gaudin was undefeated in the final with only two touches scored against him.\n1 Gaudin, Lucien Alphonse Paul France (*1886-09-27 - \u20201934-09-23)\n2 Cornereau, (Louis) Gaston France (*1888-08-31 - \u20201944-07-05)\n3 Wijnoldy-Dani\u00ebls, Henri Jacob Marie Netherlands (*1889-11-26 - \u20201932-08-20)\n1922 European Championships (Paris, FRA - 1922.VI.16-17 & Ostend, BEL - 1922.VII.29) \nMen's Epee Individual (Paris, FRA - 1922.VI.16-17) Entries: 22\nThe competition was held at Luna Park, an amusement park near Porte Maillot.

But like I always do on every trip, I needed some time to explore the city in my way, on foot, just wandering around without any particular aim. The only aim is to soak in the city, experience what the city is all about. To me, walking around is the best way to experience the city, something that cannot, in my opinion, be accomplished while driving around or taking a public transport like a bus or a cab or a subway, which will conveniently take you from point A to point B, but miss out on everything in between.\n\nSo, while walking around the city, I walked over to the old city area of Srinagar, where I walked over to one of the most renowned landmarks of the city \u2013 the Zero Bridge. You would have seen it in movies, you might have heard about it, but I assure you, walking on the bridge yourself, is a whole other experience.\n\n![](https://banjaranfoodie.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ed5bd-zero2.jpg?w=2048&h=1452)The Zero Bridge at dusk\n\n## What is the Zero Bridge?\n\nThe Zero Bridge is an old wooden arch bridge in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir. It stands over the Jhelum river in the north-south direction connecting the Sonwar area of Srinagar city in the north to the Rajbagh area in the south. The original Zero bridge was constructed in the 1950s under the the then \u201cprime minister of Jammu & Kashmir\u201d \u2013 Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad. In the late 1980s, the bridge was shut down for vehicular traffic as the wooden structure began weakening. Zero bridge is only about two kilometers from the city center of Srinagar \u2013 Lal Chowk, a place that very often comes up in our news and media, not always for the brightest reasons, but as everything in Srinagar, it does have its own charm.\n\nThe Zero Bridge is located very close to the Church Lane that houses the prime minister\u2019s private office, state circuit house, and the of...[truncated]",

Hey \nDR MAX HEY, editor of the Mineralogical \nMagazine from 1956 to 1980, died peacefully in his \nsleep in the early hours of Tuesday 24 January 1984. \nHe is survived by his widow. In his 80th year, he \nhad undergone surgery at Reading in November, \nand was convalescing at the home of his son in \nNewcastle upon Tyne. \nMax Hutchinson Hey was born on 11 March \n1904 at Leyland, Lancashire, the eldest of a family \nof four sons and a daughter. His father was a \ndepartmental head of the firm of John Stanning, \n'dyers, bleachers, and finishers', and from him Max \nand two of his brothers acquired their interest \nin chemistry. He attended Balshaw's (Leyland) \nGrammar School from 1912 until 1918, when he \nwent on to Manchester Grammar School. The \ntwice-daily journey between Leyland and MGS \ntook about three-quarters of an hour each way, and \nMax rapidly learned the knack of putting it to good \nuse by doing his homework on the train, oblivious \nto distractions. This ability added greatly to his \nproductivity later on in life, when he was com\u0002muting to the Natural History Museum. \nHe had enthusiastic teachers at MGS who gave \nhim a sound grounding in mathematics, physics, \nlanguages, and especially in chemistry. In 1921 he \ngained a 'demyship' (scholarship) to Magdalen \nCollege, Oxford, where he read chemistry and \ncrystallography, graduating as a B.A. with first \nclass honours in 1925. His final year's project, on \nthe preparation and crystallography of diphenyl\u0002acetic acid and related compounds, was the subject \nof his first publication (in German) and gained him \na B.Sc. Of his many practical instructors at Oxford, \nJ. J. Manley and T. V. Barker (a fellow Lancastrian) \nmade the most lasting impact. Max never wore a \nlab coat, remembering Manley's dictum that any\u0002one sloppy enough to need one would never make \na good analyst! The morphological and optical \ncrystallography that he learned under Barker, \ncoupled with his talent for analytical chemistry, \nprovided a formidable basis for his later work in \nmineralogy. \nThe middle years of the 1920s were not good \nfor employment, and Max considered himself \nfortunate to get a job, in November 1926, as a \nTemporary Assistant Chemist in the Food and \nDrugs Division of the Government Chemist's \nLaboratory. In May 1928 he became an Assistant \nExaminer in the Dyestuffs Section of the Patent \nOffice, and for a few months enjoyed the challenge \nof using his ear...[truncated]",

But the event got its start two years before \u2013 in 1974 in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nCelebrating its 50th Anniversary from November 1 to 20, 2024, at State Fair Park in Oklahoma City, the [AQHA World Championship Show](https://www.aqha.com/disciplines/showing/shows/championship-shows/world-show) looks back at 10 iconic moments.\n\n**Moment #1**\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\nIt\u2019s 1974 in Louisville, Kentucky, and exhibitors from more than 40 states have gathered for what would become the pinnacle event for American Quarter Horse owners \u2013 _the AQHA World Championship Show._ The show was the brainchild of an AQHA committee and the board of directors of Ponderosa Steakhouse. It lasted just four days, but saw more than 690 entries.\n\n**Moment #2**\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\nAt the first AQHA World Show in 1974, Earl Gregory played the organ for every performance. Today, announcers manage playlists with everything from rock to country and pop to blues.\n\n**Moment #3**\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\nOne thing that hasn\u2019t changed about the AQHA World Show is that the mornings come early and the nights can be late, so horsemen catch a nap whenever they can. Growing up with plow horses, Denny Hassett didn\u2019t catch the horse bug until later in life and was delighted to be at the first AQHA World Show. We caught up with Denny who shared that he also fell asleep at the All American Quarter Horse Congress that year. With 23 AQHA world championships under his belt, maybe the secret to success is a good nap.\n\n**Moment #4**\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\nThe first [AQHA Superhorse title](https://www.aqha.com/-/history-of-aqha-superhorses) was awarded to Vickie Lee Pine in 1978. Owned by Howard Pitzer, the 4-year-old bay mare was shown by his 19-year-old grandson Jim Brinkman. The pair\u00a0 captured point...[truncated]",
