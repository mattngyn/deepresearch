Text 2048 Example - Four ways to run the environment:

1. Direct Python (no Docker) - Runs in your current environment
2. Docker container - Simpler config but requires building the image first
3. Docker container - Runs in a local container (with hud helper)
4. Remote container - Runs in a remote container (with hud helper)

    # This is the most basic way to run any MCP server

    # OPTION 2: Needs: docker build -t hudpython/hud-text-2048:latest environments/text_2048
