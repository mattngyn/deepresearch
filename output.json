The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications.

Yet, beyond institutions like Harvard University and Yale University, another prestigious group stands out: the Seven Sisters—a distinguished set of liberal arts colleges renowned for their dedication to women’s education. They were founded in the 19th and early 20th centuries as counterparts to the then male-dominated Ivy League that often excluded women. Five of the Seven Sisters remain women’s colleges, shaping generations of leaders. According to [_The Hill_](https://thehill.com/opinion/education/486053-the-business-case-for-womens-colleges), 81 percent of women’s college graduates say their education highly prepared them for their first job—compared to just 61 percent from public universities—and they are nearly twice as likely to earn a postgraduate degree. The Seven Sisters have produced remarkable alumnae, including over half of all female US Secretaries of State, such as Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. Their graduates have made lasting contributions to politics, literature, science, and entertainment. This blog takes you into the world of the Seven Sisters, exploring each of its universities.\\n\\n## 1) Barnard College:\\n\\nLocated in the heart of New York City, [Barnard College](https://barnard.edu/) was founded in 1889 as one of the original Seven Sisters...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Smith College\\n\\n<tool>answer(\"Smith College\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\nAnswer submitted: Smith College\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'done()'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>search(\"women\\'s liberal arts college Smith College Cambridge Massachusetts\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\n[{\"title\":\"Home: Smith College | Smith College\",\"url\":\"https://www.smith.edu/\"},{\"title\":\"Smith College - Wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_College\"},{\"title\":\"Smith at a Glance - Smith College\",\"url\":\"https://www.smith.edu/discover-smith/smith-glance\"},{\"title\":\"Smith College - Profile, Rankings and Data | US News Best Colleges\",\"url\":\"https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/smith-college-2209\"},{\"title\":\"Smith College\",\"url\":\"https://womenscolleges.org/college/smith-college/\"}]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>fetch(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_College\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"<result>\\n[Jump to content](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#bodyContent)\\n\\n[Coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system): [42°19′3″N72°38′15″W\\ufeff / \\ufeff42.31750°N 72.63750°W\\ufeff / 42.31750;

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions.

The Westdeutscher Schachbund held 13 events from 1861 to 1880. The Norddeutscher Schachbund held three, from 1868 to 1872. The Mitteldeutscher Schachbund also held three, all in Leipzig, 1871, 1876, 1877. At Leipzig in 1877, leaders of the regional chess federations decided to form a national federation, the Deutscher Schachbund (DSB). A repeat of national DSB tournaments began in [1st DSB Congress, Leipzig (1879)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79228) and continued until 1931, whereas the regional tournaments were discontinued after 1880. The Leipzig 1877 event (organized by the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund) was called the _Anderssen-Feier_ and held in honor of Adolf Anderssen. He seemed to have lost none of his strength, finishing =2nd in the tournament. Anderssen won a playoff game with Zukertort for 2nd place and then lost to the first place finisher, Louis Paulsen, in a match by the score of 5 to 3 with one draw.

Basing his research on study of fly vision, he developed the single-layer input layer and an output layer of neural cells. Frequent presentation of a pattern or patterns resulted in changes in the input to output connections, facilitating future recognition of these patterns, or memory. His work influenced and even anticipated many modern neural network approaches.\\n\\nRecipient selection is administered through the Technical Field Awards Council of the [IEEE Awards Board](https://ethw.org/IEEE_Awards).\\n\\n## Award Recipients\\n\\n- [Lawrence J.

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications.

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.\\n\\n## Background and early life\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipe...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Adolf Anderssen'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>fetch(\"https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79429\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\n| |\\n| --- |\\n| **Leipzig (1877)** |\\n| **Leipzig, Saxony, Germany (16-21 July 1877)** ``` 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 Score Place/Prizes —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— 1 L.

The Westdeutscher Schachbund held 13 events from 1861 to 1880. The Norddeutscher Schachbund held three, from 1868 to 1872. The Mitteldeutscher Schachbund also held three, all in Leipzig, 1871, 1876, 1877. At Leipzig in 1877, leaders of the regional chess federations decided to form a national federation, the Deutscher Schachbund (DSB). A repeat of national DSB tournaments began in [1st DSB Congress, Leipzig (1879)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79228) and continued until 1931, whereas the regional tournaments were discontinued after 1880. The Leipzig 1877 event (organized by the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund) was called the _Anderssen-Feier_ and held in honor of Adolf Anderssen. He seemed to have lost none of his strength, finishing =2nd in the tournament. Anderssen won a playoff game with Zukertort for 2nd place and then lost to the first place finisher, Louis Paulsen, in a match by the score of 5 to 3 with one draw. He also played at [Paris (1878)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79634), finishing 6th in a strong field. He passed away at age 60 in March 1879. **Progressive table** ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 Paulsen, L 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 =2 Anderssen 1.0 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 =2 Zukertort 1.0 1.0 2.0 2.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 4 Winawer 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 6.5 7.5 5 Goering 0.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 =7 Englisch 0.5 1.5 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 =7 Schallopp 0.0 1.0 ...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Adolf Anderssen'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>done()</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\nAgent is done, Evaluating...\\n</result>'}], [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>search(\"Karl Küchler Empress Elizabeth of Austria\\'s favorite sculpture Achilleion Corfu\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\n[{\"title\":\"First few questions for those who don\\'t care to download.

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed.

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions.

When and where was she born? How did she meet Emperor Franz Joseph? What connected the What was Empress Elisabeth’s favorite island called? When was the Achilleion built and who was originally supposed to build it? What is it used for today? \\n Elisabeth’s love for Greece was expressed in the construction of the Achilleion. She had her Greek castle – the Achilleion – built on her favorite island of Corfu between 1889 and 1891. It was named after the Greek hero Achilleus, whom she greatly admired for his strength. \\n Theophil Hansen, the famous Ringstrasse architect, was actually supposed to build the palace on Corfu. In the end, she opted for Raffaele Cariot from Naples, who completed the designs by 1889. The marble sculpture Achill as the Dying Hero in the palace park was created by Ernst Herter. Busts of Heine, Shakespeare and Homer also adorn the garden. \\n An Austrian artist was allowed to contribute. Franz Matsch, an artist colleague of Gustav Klimt, created a fresco on the upper floor of the staircase. It again depicts Achilles, this time standing victorious on his chariot, dragging the defeated Hector to the gates of Troy. \\n This was an enormous financial burden, financed from the emperor’s private coffers. Sisi even considered emigrating to Greece altogether, which met with little understanding from Franz Joseph. He never visited her on Corfu as he disliked boat trips. However, Sisi liked to visit Corfu often. Her two daughters Gisela and Marie-Valerie visited her there once. \\n Sisi had a great fondness for ancient Greece and even learned ancient Greek. She had plenty of time to do her hair for hours in the morning. The Greek teachers sat opposite her and prepared her for Greece. Thanks to the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, the discoverer of Troy, who published a lot about the ancient archaeological sites, antiquity came back into fashion towards the end of the 19th century. \\n Sisi soon lost interest in the Achilleion and wanted to sell it, which Franz Joseph managed to prevent. It was passed on to her daughter Gisela, who sold it to the German Emperor Wilhelm II in 1907. He had it completely renovated and converted it into a 40-room palace and used it for diplomatic purposes. \\n A victorious Achilles was placed in the place of the dying one and the former private use of the castle became a public one.

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed.

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions.

The Westdeutscher Schachbund held 13 events from 1861 to 1880. The Norddeutscher Schachbund held three, from 1868 to 1872. The Mitteldeutscher Schachbund also held three, all in Leipzig, 1871, 1876, 1877. At Leipzig in 1877, leaders of the regional chess federations decided to form a national federation, the Deutscher Schachbund (DSB). A repeat of national DSB tournaments began in [1st DSB Congress, Leipzig (1879)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79228) and continued until 1931, whereas the regional tournaments were discontinued after 1880. The Leipzig 1877 event (organized by the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund) was called the _Anderssen-Feier_ and held in honor of Adolf Anderssen. He seemed to have lost none of his strength, finishing =2nd in the tournament. Anderssen won a playoff game with Zukertort for 2nd place and then lost to the first place finisher, Louis Paulsen, in a match by the score of 5 to 3 with one draw. He also played at [Paris (1878)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79634), finishing 6th in a strong field.

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography.

Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions.

When was the Achilleion built and who was originally supposed to build it? What is it used for today? \\n Elisabeth’s love for Greece was expressed in the construction of the Achilleion. She had her Greek castle – the Achilleion – built on her favorite island of Corfu between 1889 and 1891. It was named after the Greek hero Achilleus, whom she greatly admired for his strength. \\n Theophil Hansen, the famous Ringstrasse architect, was actually supposed to build the palace on Corfu. In the end, she opted for Raffaele Cariot from Naples, who completed the designs by 1889. The marble sculpture Achill as the Dying Hero in the palace park was created by Ernst Herter. Busts of Heine, Shakespeare and Homer also adorn the garden. \\n An Austrian artist was allowed to contribute. Franz Matsch, an artist colleague of Gustav Klimt, created a fresco on the upper floor of the staircase. It again depicts Achilles, this time standing victorious on his chariot, dragging the defeated Hector to the gates of Troy. \\n This was an enormous financial burden, financed from the emperor’s private coffers. Sisi even considered emigrating to Greece altogether, which met with little understanding from Franz Joseph. He never visited her on Corfu as he disliked boat trips. However, Sisi liked to visit Corfu often. Her two daughters Gisela and Marie-Valerie visited her there once. \\n Sisi had a great fondness for ancient Greece and even learned ancient Greek. She had plenty of time to do her hair for hours in the morning. The Greek teachers sat opposite her and prepared her for Greece. Thanks to the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, the discoverer of Troy, who published a lot about the ancient archaeological sites, antiquity came back into fashion towards the end of the 19th century. \\n Sisi soon lost interest in the Achilleion and wanted to sell it, which Franz Joseph managed to prevent. It was passed on to her daughter Gisela, who sold it to the German Emperor Wilhelm II in 1907. He had it completely renovated and converted it into a 40-room palace and used it for diplomatic purposes. \\n A victorious Achilles was placed in the place of the dying one and the former private use of the castle became a public one.

In the end, she opted for Raffaele Cariot from Naples, who completed the designs by 1889. The marble sculpture Achill as the Dying Hero in the palace park was created by Ernst Herter. Busts of Heine, Shakespeare and Homer also adorn the garden. \\n An Austrian artist was allowed to contribute. Franz Matsch, an artist colleague of Gustav Klimt, created a fresco on the upper floor of the staircase. It again depicts Achilles, this time standing victorious on his chariot, dragging the defeated Hector to the gates of Troy. \\n This was an enormous financial burden, financed from the emperor’s private coffers. Sisi even considered emigrating to Greece altogether, which met with little understanding from Franz Joseph. He never visited her on Corfu as he disliked boat trips. However, Sisi liked to visit Corfu often. Her two daughters Gisela and Marie-Valerie visited her there once. \\n Sisi had a great fondness for ancient Greece and even learned ancient Greek. She had plenty of time to do her hair for hours in the morning. The Greek teachers sat opposite her and prepared her for Greece. Thanks to the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, the discoverer of Troy, who published a lot about the ancient archaeological sites, antiquity came back into fashion towards the end of the 19th century. \\n Sisi soon lost interest in the Achilleion and wanted to sell it, which Franz Joseph managed to prevent. It was passed on to her daughter Gisela, who sold it to the German Emperor Wilhelm II in 1907. He had it completely renovated and converted it into a 40-room palace and used it for diplomatic purposes. \\n A victorious Achilles was placed in the place of the dying one and the former private use of the castle became a public one. The garden of the castle is huge and stretches over a hill between Corfu Town and Morajitika. \\n During the First...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>answer(\"It depicted Achilles as the Dying Hero.\")</tool>\\n<tool>done()</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\nAnswer submitted: It depicted Achilles as the Dying Hero.\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'It depicted Achilles as the Dying Hero.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>answer(\"It depicted Achilles as the Dying Hero.\")</tool>\\n<tool>done()</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\nAnswer submitted: It depicted Achilles as the Dying Hero.\\n</result>'}], [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>search(\"IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award 2010 recipient\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\n[{\"title\":\"IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award Recipients\",\"url\":\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/rosenblatt-rl.pdf\"},{\"title\":\"IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award - Wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Frank_Rosenblatt_Award\"},{\"title\":\"IEEE Awards - IEEE Computational Intelligence Society\",\"url\":\"https://cis.ieee.org/awards/ieee-awards\"},{\"title\":\"IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award\",\"url\":\"https://ethw.org/IEEE_Frank_Rosenblatt_Award\"},{\"title\":\"CIS Awards - IEEE Computational Intelligence Society\",\"url\":\"https://cis.ieee.org/awards/13-cis-awards\"}]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>fetch(\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/rosenblatt-rl.pdf\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\nIEEE FRANK ROSENBLATT AWARD\\nRECIPIENTS\\n1 of 3\\n2026 – ANDREW G.

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed.

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed.

Yet, beyond institutions like Harvard University and Yale University, another prestigious group stands out: the Seven Sisters—a distinguished set of liberal arts colleges renowned for their dedication to women’s education. They were founded in the 19th and early 20th centuries as counterparts to the then male-dominated Ivy League that often excluded women. Five of the Seven Sisters remain women’s colleges, shaping generations of leaders. According to [_The Hill_](https://thehill.com/opinion/education/486053-the-business-case-for-womens-colleges), 81 percent of women’s college graduates say their education highly prepared them for their first job—compared to just 61 percent from public universities—and they are nearly twice as likely to earn a postgraduate degree. The Seven Sisters have produced remarkable alumnae, including over half of all female US Secretaries of State, such as Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. Their graduates have made lasting contributions to politics, literature, science, and entertainment.

Crafted from pure white marble, the figure of Achilles is rendered with exquisite precision, the breadth of his muscular form displaying Ernst Herter’s impeccable attention to detail.\\n\\nAchilles is portrayed at his moment of greatest vulnerability, his body slumped and face etched with the pain of Paris’ fatal arrow. His left hand clutches at the Trojan arrow embedded in his heel – his only weak point, while his right hand weakly grasps a short sword, an emblem of the warrior’s indomitable spirit, even in the face of death.\\n\\nNotwithstanding his formidable reputation as an invincible warrior, this statue represents a poignant contrast, underscoring the inescapable human frailty that even Achilles could not avoid.

Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography.\\n\\n#### **About the Award**\\n\\n# ![](https://oceanopticsconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jerlov_medal1.jpg)\\n\\nNils Gunnar Jerlov was an early leader in the area of ocean optics research. His name is recognized widely within the entire international oceanographic research community. Jerlov’s theoretical and experimental work on ocean optical and related processes helped form the foundation of modern ocean optical research. He proposed the concept of an optical ocean water mass classification and the Jerlov water types are familiar to many outside of the ocean optics community. His book, _Marine Optics_, published in 1976, remains widely referenced and is considered required reading for all students of ocean optics and ocean color remote sensing. The Oceanography Society (TOS) commemorates Dr. Jerlov and his many contributions to the study of light in the ocean with an international award, established in his name.

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions.

The Westdeutscher Schachbund held 13 events from 1861 to 1880. The Norddeutscher Schachbund held three, from 1868 to 1872. The Mitteldeutscher Schachbund also held three, all in Leipzig, 1871, 1876, 1877. At Leipzig in 1877, leaders of the regional chess federations decided to form a national federation, the Deutscher Schachbund (DSB). A repeat of national DSB tournaments began in [1st DSB Congress, Leipzig (1879)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79228) and continued until 1931, whereas the regional tournaments were discontinued after 1880. The Leipzig 1877 event (organized by the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund) was called the _Anderssen-Feier_ and held in honor of Adolf Anderssen. He seemed to have lost none of his strength, finishing =2nd in the tournament. Anderssen won a playoff game with Zukertort for 2nd place and then lost to the first place finisher, Louis Paulsen, in a match by the score of 5 to 3 with one draw.

Basing his research on study of fly vision, he developed the single-layer input layer and an output layer of neural cells. Frequent presentation of a pattern or patterns resulted in changes in the input to output connections, facilitating future recognition of these patterns, or memory. His work influenced and anticipated many modern neural network approaches. \\n This award will be presented for outstanding contributions to the advancement of the design, practice, techniques or theory in biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms including but not limited to neural networks, connectionist systems, evolutionary computation, fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems in which these paradigms are contained. \\n This award may be presented to an individual, multiple recipients, or a team of not more than three members. This award is administered by the Technical Field Awards Council of the IEEE Awards Board.

Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography.\\n\\n#### **About the Award**\\n\\n# ![](https://oceanopticsconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jerlov_medal1.jpg)\\n\\nNils Gunnar Jerlov was an early leader in the area of ocean optics research. His name is recognized widely within the entire international oceanographic research community. Jerlov’s theoretical and experimental work on ocean optical and related processes helped form the foundation of modern ocean optical research. He proposed the concept of an optical ocean water mass classification and the Jerlov water types are familiar to many outside of the ocean optics community.

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.\\n\\n## Background and early life\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipe...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Adolf Anderssen'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>fetch(\"https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79429\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\n| |\\n| --- |\\n| **Leipzig (1877)** |\\n| **Leipzig, Saxony, Germany (16-21 July 1877)** ``` 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 Score Place/Prizes —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— 1 L.

The Westdeutscher Schachbund held 13 events from 1861 to 1880. The Norddeutscher Schachbund held three, from 1868 to 1872. The Mitteldeutscher Schachbund also held three, all in Leipzig, 1871, 1876, 1877. At Leipzig in 1877, leaders of the regional chess federations decided to form a national federation, the Deutscher Schachbund (DSB). A repeat of national DSB tournaments began in [1st DSB Congress, Leipzig (1879)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79228) and continued until 1931, whereas the regional tournaments were discontinued after 1880. The Leipzig 1877 event (organized by the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund) was called the _Anderssen-Feier_ and held in honor of Adolf Anderssen. He seemed to have lost none of his strength, finishing =2nd in the tournament. Anderssen won a playoff game with Zukertort for 2nd place and then lost to the first place finisher, Louis Paulsen, in a match by the score of 5 to 3 with one draw. He also played at [Paris (1878)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79634), finishing 6th in a strong field. He passed away at age 60 in March 1879. **Progressive table** ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 Paulsen, L 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 =2 Anderssen 1.0 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 =2 Zukertort 1.0 1.0 2.0 2.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 4 Winawer 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 6.5 7.5 5 Goering 0.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 =7 Englisch 0.5 1.5 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 =7 Schallopp 0.0 1.0 ...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Adolf Anderssen'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>done()</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\nAgent is done, Evaluating...\\n</result>'}], [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>search(\"Karl Küchler Empress Elizabeth of Austria\\'s favorite sculpture Achilleion Corfu\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\n[{\"title\":\"Improving Factuality in LLMs via Inference-Time Knowledge Graph ...\",\"url\":\"https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03540\"},{\"title\":\"First few questions for those who don\\'t care to download.

Basing his research on study of fly vision, he developed the single-layer input layer and an output layer of neural cells. Frequent presentation of a pattern or patterns resulted in changes in the input to output connections, facilitating future recognition of these patterns, or memory. His work influenced and even anticipated many modern neural network approaches.\\n\\nRecipient selection is administered through the Technical Field Awards Council of the [IEEE Awards Board](https://ethw.org/IEEE_Awards).\\n\\n## Award Recipients\\n\\n- [Lawrence J.

Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography.\\n\\n#### **About the Award**\\n\\n# ![](https://oceanopticsconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jerlov_medal1.jpg)\\n\\nNils Gunnar Jerlov was an early leader in the area of ocean optics research. His name is recognized widely within the entire international oceanographic research community. Jerlov’s theoretical and experimental work on ocean optical and related processes helped form the foundation of modern ocean optical research. He proposed the concept of an optical ocean water mass classification and the Jerlov water types are familiar to many outside of the ocean optics community. His book, _Marine Optics_, published in 1976, remains widely referenced and is considered required reading for all students of ocean optics and ocean color remote sensing. The Oceanography Society (TOS) commemorates Dr. Jerlov and his many contributions to the study of light in the ocean with an international award, established in his name.

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed.

Yet, beyond institutions like Harvard University and Yale University, another prestigious group stands out: the Seven Sisters—a distinguished set of liberal arts colleges renowned for their dedication to women’s education. They were founded in the 19th and early 20th centuries as counterparts to the then male-dominated Ivy League that often excluded women. Five of the Seven Sisters remain women’s colleges, shaping generations of leaders. According to [_The Hill_](https://thehill.com/opinion/education/486053-the-business-case-for-womens-colleges), 81 percent of women’s college graduates say their education highly prepared them for their first job—compared to just 61 percent from public universities—and they are nearly twice as likely to earn a postgraduate degree. The Seven Sisters have produced remarkable alumnae, including over half of all female US Secretaries of State, such as Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. Their graduates have made lasting contributions to politics, literature, science, and entertainment. This blog takes you into the world of the Seven Sisters, exploring each of its universities.\\n\\n## 1) Barnard College:\\n\\nLocated in the heart of New York City, [Barnard College](https://barnard.edu/) was founded in 1889 as one of the original Seven Sisters...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Smith College\\n\\n<tool>answer(\"Smith College\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\nAnswer submitted: Smith College\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'done()'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>search(\"women\\'s liberal arts college Smith College Cambridge Massachusetts\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\n[{\"title\":\"Home: Smith College | Smith College\",\"url\":\"https://www.smith.edu/\"},{\"title\":\"Smith College - Wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_College\"},{\"title\":\"Smith at a Glance - Smith College\",\"url\":\"https://www.smith.edu/discover-smith/smith-glance\"},{\"title\":\"Smith College - Profile, Rankings and Data | US News Best Colleges\",\"url\":\"https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/smith-college-2209\"},{\"title\":\"Smith College\",\"url\":\"https://womenscolleges.org/college/smith-college/\"}]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>fetch(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_College\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"<result>\\n[Jump to content](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#bodyContent)\\n\\n[Coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system): [42°19′3″N72°38′15″W\\ufeff / \\ufeff42.31750°N 72.63750°W\\ufeff / 42.31750;

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.\\n\\n## Background and early life\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipe...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Adolf Anderssen'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>fetch(\"https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79429\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\n| |\\n| --- |\\n| **Leipzig (1877)** |\\n| **Leipzig, Saxony, Germany (16-21 July 1877)** ``` 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 Score Place/Prizes —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— 1 L.

The Westdeutscher Schachbund held 13 events from 1861 to 1880. The Norddeutscher Schachbund held three, from 1868 to 1872. The Mitteldeutscher Schachbund also held three, all in Leipzig, 1871, 1876, 1877. At Leipzig in 1877, leaders of the regional chess federations decided to form a national federation, the Deutscher Schachbund (DSB). A repeat of national DSB tournaments began in [1st DSB Congress, Leipzig (1879)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79228) and continued until 1931, whereas the regional tournaments were discontinued after 1880. The Leipzig 1877 event (organized by the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund) was called the _Anderssen-Feier_ and held in honor of Adolf Anderssen. He seemed to have lost none of his strength, finishing =2nd in the tournament. Anderssen won a playoff game with Zukertort for 2nd place and then lost to the first place finisher, Louis Paulsen, in a match by the score of 5 to 3 with one draw. He also played at [Paris (1878)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79634), finishing 6th in a strong field. He passed away at age 60 in March 1879. **Progressive table** ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 Paulsen, L 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 =2 Anderssen 1.0 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5

Basing his research on study of fly vision, he developed the single-layer input layer and an output layer of neural cells. Frequent presentation of a pattern or patterns resulted in changes in the input to output connections, facilitating future recognition of these patterns, or memory. His work influenced and even anticipated many modern neural network approaches.\\n\\nRecipient selection is administered through the Technical Field Awards Council of the [IEEE Awards Board](https://ethw.org/IEEE_Awards).\\n\\n## Award Recipients\\n\\n- [Lawrence J.

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed.

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.\\n\\n## Background and early life\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipe...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Adolf Anderssen'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>fetch(\"https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79429\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\n| |\\n| --- |\\n| **Leipzig (1877)** |\\n| **Leipzig, Saxony, Germany (16-21 July 1877)** ``` 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 Score Place/Prizes —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— 1 L.

The Westdeutscher Schachbund held 13 events from 1861 to 1880. The Norddeutscher Schachbund held three, from 1868 to 1872. The Mitteldeutscher Schachbund also held three, all in Leipzig, 1871, 1876, 1877. At Leipzig in 1877, leaders of the regional chess federations decided to form a national federation, the Deutscher Schachbund (DSB). A repeat of national DSB tournaments began in [1st DSB Congress, Leipzig (1879)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79228) and continued until 1931, whereas the regional tournaments were discontinued after 1880. The Leipzig 1877 event (organized by the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund) was called the _Anderssen-Feier_ and held in honor of Adolf Anderssen. He seemed to have lost none of his strength, finishing =2nd in the tournament. Anderssen won a playoff game with Zukertort for 2nd place and then lost to the first place finisher, Louis Paulsen, in a match by the score of 5 to 3 with one draw. He also played at [Paris (1878)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79634), finishing 6th in a strong field. He passed away at age 60 in March 1879. **Progressive table** ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 Paulsen, L 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 =2 Anderssen 1.0 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed. Hence Annick had to design and build, for her PhD research, h...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Annick Bricaud'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'},

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.\\n\\n## Background and early life\\n\\n\\\\[

When and where was she born? How did she meet Emperor Franz Joseph? What connected the What was Empress Elisabeth’s favorite island called? When was the Achilleion built and who was originally supposed to build it? What is it used for today? \\n Elisabeth’s love for Greece was expressed in the construction of the Achilleion. She had her Greek castle – the Achilleion – built on her favorite island of Corfu between 1889 and 1891. It was named after the Greek hero Achilleus, whom she greatly admired for his strength. \\n Theophil Hansen, the famous Ringstrasse architect, was actually supposed to build the palace on Corfu. In the end, she opted for Raffaele Cariot from Naples, who completed the designs by 1889. The marble sculpture Achill as the Dying Hero in the palace park was created by Ernst Herter. Busts of Heine, Shakespeare and Homer also adorn the garden. \\n An Austrian artist was allowed to contribute. Franz Matsch, an artist colleague of Gustav Klimt, created a fresco on the upper floor of the staircase. It again depicts Achilles, this time standing victorious on his chariot, dragging the defeated Hector to the gates of Troy. \\n This was an enormous financial burden, financed from the emperor’s private coffers. Sisi even considered emigrating to Greece altogether, which met with little understanding from Franz Joseph. He never visited her on Corfu as he disliked boat trips. However, Sisi liked to visit Corfu often. Her two daughters Gisela and Marie-Valerie visited her there once. \\n Sisi had a great fondness for ancient Greece and even learned ancient Greek. She had plenty of time to do her hair for hours in the morning. The Greek teachers sat opposite her and prepared her for Greece. Thanks to the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, the discoverer of Troy, who published a lot about the ancient archaeological sites, antiquity came back into fashion towards the end of the 19th century. \\n Sisi soon lost interest in the Achilleion and wanted to sell it, which Franz Joseph managed to prevent. It was passed on to her daughter Gisela, who sold it to the German Emperor Wilhelm II in 1907. He had it completely renovated and converted it into a 40-room palace and used it for diplomatic purposes. \\n A victorious Achilles was placed in the place of the dying one and the former private use of the castle became a public one. The garden of the castle is huge and stretches over a hill between Corfu Town and Morajitika. \\n During the First...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content':

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed. Hence Annick had to design and build, for her PhD research, h...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Annick Bricaud'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'},

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866.

He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions.

The Westdeutscher Schachbund held 13 events from 1861 to 1880. The Norddeutscher Schachbund held three, from 1868 to 1872. The Mitteldeutscher Schachbund also held three, all in Leipzig, 1871, 1876, 1877. At Leipzig in 1877, leaders of the regional chess federations decided to form a national federation, the Deutscher Schachbund (DSB). A repeat of national DSB tournaments began in [1st DSB Congress, Leipzig (1879)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79228) and continued until 1931, whereas the regional tournaments were discontinued after 1880. The Leipzig 1877 event (organized by the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund) was called the _Anderssen-Feier_ and held in honor of Adolf Anderssen. He seemed to have lost none of his strength, finishing =2nd in the tournament. Anderssen won a playoff game with Zukertort for 2nd place and then lost to the first place finisher, Louis Paulsen, in a match by the score of 5 to 3 with one draw. He also played at [Paris (1878)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79634), finishing 6th in a strong field. He passed away at age 60 in March 1879. **Progressive table** ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 Paulsen, L 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 =2 Anderssen 1.0 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed. Hence Annick had to design and build, for her PhD research, h...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Annick Bricaud'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'},

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.\\n\\n## Background and early life\\n\\n\\\\[

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed. Hence Annick had to design and build, for her PhD research, h...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Annick Bricaud'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'},

Basing his research on study of fly vision, he developed the single-layer input layer and an output layer of neural cells. Frequent presentation of a pattern or patterns resulted in changes in the input to output connections, facilitating future recognition of these patterns, or memory. His work influenced and anticipated many modern neural network approaches.\\n\\nThis award will be presented for outstanding contributions to the advancement of the design, practice, techniques or

You must call done() when you have finished your research and you have called <tool>search(\"your search query\")</tool>.

Your answer will not be graded if you do not call <tool>answer(\"Your researched answer here\")</tool> with your final answer when you have finished your research. Do not emit thinking or reasoning tokens. Provide only your final answer, no other text.

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.\\n\\nThe nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, \"Annick\\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed.

Yet, beyond institutions like Harvard University and Yale University, another prestigious group stands out: the Seven Sisters—a distinguished set of liberal arts colleges renowned for their dedication to women’s education. They were founded in the 19th and early 20th centuries as counterparts to the then male-dominated Ivy League that often excluded women. Five of the Seven Sisters remain women’s colleges, shaping generations of leaders. According to [_The Hill_](https://thehill.com/opinion/education/486053-the-business-case-for-womens-colleges), 81 percent of women’s college graduates say their education highly prepared them for their first job—compared to just 61 percent from public universities—and they are nearly twice as likely to earn a postgraduate degree. The Seven Sisters have produced remarkable alumnae, including over half of all female US Secretaries of State, such as Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. Their graduates have made lasting contributions to politics, literature, science, and entertainment.

Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography.\\n\\n#### **About the Award**\\n\\n# ![](https://oceanopticsconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jerlov_medal1.jpg)\\n\\nNils Gunnar Jerlov was an early leader in the area of ocean optics research. His name is recognized widely within the entire international oceanographic research community. Jerlov’s theoretical and experimental work on ocean optical and related processes helped form the foundation of modern ocean optical research. He proposed the concept of an optical ocean water mass classification and the Jerlov water types are familiar to many outside of the ocean optics community.

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.\\n\\n## Background and early life\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipe...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Adolf Anderssen'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>fetch(\"https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79429\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\n| |\\n| --- |\\n| **Leipzig (1877)** |\\n| **Leipzig, Saxony, Germany (16-21 July 1877)** ``` 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 Score Place/Prizes —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— 1 L.

The Westdeutscher Schachbund held 13 events from 1861 to 1880. The Norddeutscher Schachbund held three, from 1868 to 1872. The Mitteldeutscher Schachbund also held three, all in Leipzig, 1871, 1876, 1877. At Leipzig in 1877, leaders of the regional chess federations decided to form a national federation, the Deutscher Schachbund (DSB). A repeat of national DSB tournaments began in [1st DSB Congress, Leipzig (1879)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79228) and continued until 1931, whereas the regional tournaments were discontinued after 1880. The Leipzig 1877 event (organized by the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund) was called the _Anderssen-Feier_ and held in honor of Adolf Anderssen. He seemed to have lost none of his strength, finishing =2nd in the tournament. Anderssen won a playoff game with Zukertort for 2nd place and then lost to the first place finisher, Louis Paulsen, in a match by the score of 5 to 3 with one draw. He also played at [Paris (1878)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79634), finishing 6th in a strong field. He passed away at age 60 in March 1879. **Progressive table** ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 Paulsen, L 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 =2 Anderssen 1.0 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5

Basing his research on study of fly vision, he developed the single-layer input layer and an output layer of neural cells. Frequent presentation of a pattern or patterns resulted in changes in the input to output connections, facilitating future recognition of these patterns, or memory. His work influenced and anticipated many modern neural network approaches. \\n This award will be presented for outstanding contributions to the advancement of the design, practice, techniques or theory in biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms including but not limited to neural networks, connectionist systems, evolutionary computation, fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems in which these paradigms are contained. \\n This award may be presented to an individual, multiple recipients, or a team of not more than three members. This award is administered by the Technical Field Awards Council of the IEEE Awards Board. Prize items include a bronze medal, certificate and honorarium. \\n \\n View past IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award Recipients (PDF) \\n \\n \\n Congratulations to\\xa0 Yaochu Jin \\n Recipient of the 2025 IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Technical Field Award \\n \\n The IEEE Computational Intelligence Society is most pleased to announce that Yaochu Jin has been selected as the recipient of th...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Jürgen Schmidhuber received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2016.

Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography.\\n\\n#### **About the Award**\\n\\n# ![](https://oceanopticsconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jerlov_medal1.jpg)\\n\\nNils Gunnar Jerlov was an early leader in the area of ocean optics research. His name is recognized widely within the entire international oceanographic research community. Jerlov’s theoretical and experimental work on ocean optical and related processes helped form the foundation of modern ocean optical research. He proposed the concept of an optical ocean water mass classification and the Jerlov water types are familiar to many outside of the ocean optics community. His book, _Marine Optics_, published in 1976, remains widely referenced and is considered required reading for all students of ocean optics and ocean color remote sensing. The Oceanography Society (TOS) commemorates Dr. Jerlov and his many contributions to the study of light in the ocean with an international award, established in his name.

He won the great international tournaments of [1851](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament) and [1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1862_chess_tournament), but lost matches to [Paul Morphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy) in 1858, and to [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of [World Chess Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Champion) did not yet exist.\\n\\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong [Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-Baden_1870_chess_tournament). He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.\\n\\nAnderssen is famous today for his brilliant [sacrificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_(chess)) attacking play, particularly in the [Immortal Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortal_Game) (1851) and the [Evergreen Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Game) (1852). He was an important figure in the development of [chess problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem), driving forward the transition from the \"Old School\" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.\\n\\n## Background and early life\\n\\n\\\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipe...[truncated]\\n</result>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Adolf Anderssen'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Missing Tool Call'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<tool>fetch(\"https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79429\")</tool>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '<result>\\n| |\\n| --- |\\n| **Leipzig (1877)** |\\n| **Leipzig, Saxony, Germany (16-21 July 1877)** ``` 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 Score Place/Prizes —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— 1 L.

The Westdeutscher Schachbund held 13 events from 1861 to 1880. The Norddeutscher Schachbund held three, from 1868 to 1872. The Mitteldeutscher Schachbund also held three, all in Leipzig, 1871, 1876, 1877. At Leipzig in 1877, leaders of the regional chess federations decided to form a national federation, the Deutscher Schachbund (DSB). A repeat of national DSB tournaments began in [1st DSB Congress, Leipzig (1879)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79228) and continued until 1931, whereas the regional tournaments were discontinued after 1880. The Leipzig 1877 event (organized by the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund) was called the _Anderssen-Feier_ and held in honor of Adolf Anderssen. He seemed to have lost none of his strength, finishing =2nd in the tournament. Anderssen won a playoff game with Zukertort for 2nd place and then lost to the first place finisher, Louis Paulsen, in a match by the score of 5 to 3 with one draw. He also played at [Paris (1878)](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?tid=79634), finishing 6th in a strong field. He passed away at age 60 in March 1879. **Progressive table** ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 Paulsen, L 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 =2 Anderssen 1.0 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5

Basing his research on study of fly vision, he developed the single-layer input layer and an output layer of neural cells. Frequent presentation of a pattern or patterns resulted in changes in the input to output connections, facilitating future recognition of these patterns, or memory.

Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography.\\n\\n#### **About the Award**\\n\\n# ![](https://oceanopticsconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jerlov_medal1.jpg)\\n\\nNils Gunnar Jerlov was an early leader in the area of ocean optics research. His name is recognized widely within the entire international oceanographic research community. Jerlov’s theoretical and experimental work on ocean optical and related processes helped form the foundation of modern ocean optical research. He proposed the concept of an optical ocean water mass classification and the Jerlov water types are familiar to many outside of the ocean optics community. His book, _Marine Optics_, published in 1976, remains widely referenced and is considered required reading for all students of ocean optics and ocean color remote sensing. The Oceanography Society (TOS) commemorates Dr. Jerlov and his many contributions to the study of light in the ocean with an international award, established in his name.
